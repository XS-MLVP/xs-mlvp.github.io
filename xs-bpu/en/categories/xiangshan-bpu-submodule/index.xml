      <title>BPU Top Module</title>

      <description>The overall function and structure of the BPU top level have been roughly described in previous documents. For those verifying the BPU top level, a more detailed description might be needed. Due to the many functions of the BPU top level, this section divides the BPU into several major functional points for further description. However, since there are too many details at the BPU top level, further details need to be understood by referring to the code.</description>

      <title>FTB Branch Predictor</title>

      <description>Introduction to FTB FTB is the third sub-predictor of the Xiangshan BPU, and it can also get the outputs of uFTB and TAGE-SC together. In the input interface of FTB, the s1 channel contains the basic prediction results of uFTB, and the s2 and s3 channels are filled with only one group of signals, br_taken_mask, by TAGE-SC, without the basic prediction results generated by the FTB entry. The function of FTB is to provide basic prediction results for the s2 and s3 channels.</description>

      <title>ITTAGE Branch Predictor</title>

      <description>Function Introduction For general conditional branch instructions, only predicting whether to jump (taken) or not (not taken) is needed. However, for indirect jumps, such as call/jump instructions, it is necessary to predict where to jump to (Target). In order to make TAGE support predicting jump addresses, ITTAGE (Indirect Target TAGE) was introduced.&#xA;The main difference between ITTAGE and TAGE is that in the T0 and Tn tables, Target PC data is added.</description>
