      <description>In processor design, a well-designed branch predictor (BPU) is a key component for improving processor performance. It is responsible for guiding the processor&amp;rsquo;s fetch, determining where the next instruction should be fetched and executed. The BPU is the starting point of an instruction&amp;rsquo;s lifecycle, so exploring a high-performance processor from the BPU is a good starting point.&#xA;This is also true for Shanshan, a high-performance processor with out-of-order six-issue execution, which naturally requires a branch prediction unit with high accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>What is Branch Prediction</title>

      <description>Why Do We Need Branch Prediction? There are mainly two reasons for branch prediction: one is that the program&amp;rsquo;s execution flow contains branch instructions, and the other is that high-performance processors use pipeline design.&#xA;Program&amp;rsquo;s Execution Flow Contains Branch Instructions int x = 10; int y = 20; int result = 0; if (x &amp;gt;= y) { result = x + y; } else { result = x - y; } The above is a piece of C code.</description>
