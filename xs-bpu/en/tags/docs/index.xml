      <description>The Feature List in hardware verification lists various functions and characteristics of the design that need to be verified. Before starting verification, we generally list the features of the design to clarify which features need to be verified in this task.&#xA;To verify a feature in the feature list, we will build the necessary test points for this feature and write test cases to cover these test points. Therefore, the feature list is not only a description of the features of the design to be verified but also a guide for our verification direction and a simple summary of the verification task.</description>
