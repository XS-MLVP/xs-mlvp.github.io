      <description>The overall function and structure of the BPU top level have been roughly described in previous documents. For those verifying the BPU top level, a more detailed description might be needed. Due to the many functions of the BPU top level, this section divides the BPU into several major functional points for further description. However, since there are too many details at the BPU top level, further details need to be understood by referring to the code.</description>

      <description>Single-Cycle Prediction without Bubble uFTB is the only predictor in Xiangshan BPU that can generate prediction results in a single cycle. The figure below shows the prediction process of uFTB. The s0_pc is sent from the top level of BPU, and when the s1 stage is active, the s1_pc retains the value of s0_pc from the previous cycle. This means that the value of s0_pc will move down the pipeline.</description>
