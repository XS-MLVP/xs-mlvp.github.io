[{"body":" This page provides a brief introduction to chip verification, including concepts used in examples such as DUT (Design Under Test) and RM (Reference Model).\nThe chip verification process needs to align with the actual situation of the company or team. There is no absolute standard that meets all requirements and must be referenced.\nWhat is Chip Verification? The chip design-to-production process involves three main stages: chip design, chip manufacturing, and chip packaging/testing. Chip design is further divided into front-end and back-end design. Front-end design, also known as logic design, aims to achieve the desired circuit logic functionality. Back-end design, or physical design, focuses on optimizing layout and routing to reduce chip area, lower power consumption, and increase frequency. Chip verification is a critical step in the chip design process. Its goal is to ensure that the designed chip meets the specified requirements in terms of functionality, performance, and power consumption. The verification process typically includes functional verification, timing verification, and power verification, using methods and tools such as simulation, formal verification, hardware acceleration, and prototyping. For this tutorial, chip verification refers only to the verification of the front-end design to ensure that the circuit logic meets the specified requirements (“Does this proposed design do what is intended?”), commonly known as functional verification. This does not include back-end design aspects like power and frequency.\nFor chip products, design errors that make it to production can be extremely costly to fix, as it might require recalling products and remanufacturing chips, incurring significant financial and time costs. Here are some classic examples of failures due to inadequate chip verification: Intel Pentium FDIV Bug：In 1994, Intel’s Pentium processor was found to have a severe division error known as the FDIV bug. This error was due to incorrect entries in a lookup table within the chip’s floating-point unit. Although it rarely affected most applications, it caused incorrect results in specific calculations. Intel had to recall a large number of processors, leading to significant financial losses.\nAriane 5 Rocket Failure：Though not a chip example, this highlights the importance of hardware verification. In 1996, the European Space Agency’s Ariane 5 rocket exploded shortly after launch due to an overflow when converting a 64-bit floating-point number to a 16-bit integer in the navigation system, causing the system to crash. This error went undetected during design and led to the rocket’s failure.\nAMD Barcelona Bug：In 2007, AMD’s Barcelona processor had a severe Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) error that could cause system crashes or reboots. AMD had to mitigate this by lowering the processor’s frequency and releasing BIOS updates, which negatively impacted their reputation and financial status.\nThese cases emphasize the importance of chip verification. Errors detected and fixed during the design phase can prevent these costly failures. Insufficient verification continues to cause issues today, such as a new entrant in the ASIC chip market rushing a 55nm chip without proper verification, leading to three failed tape-outs and approximately $500,000 in losses per failure.\nChip Verification Process The coupling relationship between chip design and verification is shown in the diagram above. Both design and verification have the same input: the specification document. Based on this document, both design and verification teams independently code according to their understanding and requirements. The design team needs to ensure that the RTL code is “synthesizable,” considering circuit characteristics, while the verification team mainly focuses on whether the functionality meets the requirements, with fewer coding constraints. After both teams complete module development, a sanity test is conducted to check if the functionality matches. If there are discrepancies, collaborative debugging is done to identify and fix issues before retesting. Due to the high coupling between chip design and verification, some companies directly couple their design and verification teams, assigning verification teams to each design submodule. The coupling process in the diagram is coarse-grained, with specific chips (e.g., SoC, DDR) and companies having their cooperation models.\nIn the above comparison test, the module produced by the design team is usually called DUT (Design Under Test), while the model developed by the verification team is called RM (Reference Model). The verification process includes: writing a verification plan, creating a verification platform, organizing functional points, constructing test cases, running and debugging, collecting bugs/coverage, regression testing, and writing test reports.\nVerification Plan： The verification plan describes how verification will be carried out and how verification quality will be ensured to meet functional verification requirements. It typically includes verification goals, strategies, environment, items, process, risk mitigation, resources, schedule, results, and reports. Verification goals specify the functions or performance metrics to be verified, directly extracted from the chip specification. Verification strategy outlines the methods to be used, such as simulation, formal verification, FPGA acceleration, etc., and how to organize the verification tasks. The verification environment details the specific testing environment, including verification tools and versions. The verification item library lists specific items to be verified and expected results. Verification plans can be general or specific to sub-tasks.\nPlatform Setup： The verification platform is the execution environment for specific verification tasks. Similar verification tasks can use the same platform. Setting up the platform is a key step, including choosing verification tools (e.g., software simulation, formal verification, hardware acceleration), configuring the environment (e.g., server, FPGA), creating the test environment, and basic test cases. Initial basic test cases are often called “smoke tests.” Subsequent test codes are based on this platform, so it must be reusable. The platform includes the test framework, the code being tested, and basic signal stimuli.\nOrganizing Functional Points： This involves listing the DUT’s basic functions based on the specification manual and detailing how to test each function. Functional points are prioritized based on importance, risk, and complexity. They also need to be tracked for status, with updates synchronized to the plan if changes occur.\nTest Cases These are conditions or variables used to determine if the DUT meets specific requirements and operates correctly. Each case includes test conditions, input data, expected results, actual results, and test outcomes. Running test cases and comparing expected vs. actual results help verify the system or application’s correct implementation of functions or requirements. Test cases are crucial tools for verifying chip design against specifications.\nCoding Implementation： This is the execution of test cases, including generating test data, selecting the test framework, programming language, and writing the reference model. This phase requires a deep understanding of functional points and test cases. Misunderstandings can lead to the DUT being undrivable or undetected bugs.\nCollecting Bugs/Coverage： The goal of verification is to find design bugs early, so collected bugs need unique identifiers, severity ratings, and status tracking with design engineers. Discovering bugs is ideal, but since not every test finds bugs, coverage is another metric to evaluate verification thoroughness. Sufficient verification is indicated when coverage (e.g., code coverage \u003e90%) exceeds a threshold.\nRegression Testing： As verification and design are iterative, regression tests ensure the modified DUT still functions correctly after bug fixes. This catches new errors or reactivates old ones due to changes. Regression tests can be comprehensive or selective, covering all functions or specific parts.\nTest Report： This summarizes the entire verification process, providing a comprehensive view of the testing activities, including objectives, executed test cases, discovered issues, coverage, and efficiency.\nLevels of Chip Verification Chip verification typically includes four levels based on the object size: UT, BT, IT, and ST.\nUnit Testing（UT）： The lowest verification level, focusing on single modules or components to ensure their functionality is correct.\nBlock Testing (BT) ： Modules often have tight coupling, making isolated UT testing complex. BT merges several coupled modules into one DUT block for testing.\nIntegration Testing (IT) ： Builds on UT by combining multiple modules or components to verify their collaborative functionality, usually testing subsystem functionality.\nSystem Testing (ST) ： Also called Top verification, ST combines all modules or components into a complete system to verify overall functionality and performance requirements.\nIn theory, these levels follow a bottom-up order, each building on the previous level. However, practical verification activities depend on the scale, expertise, and functional needs of the enterprise, so not all levels are always involved. At each level, relevant test cases are written, tests run, and results analyzed to ensure the chip design’s correctness and quality.\nChip Verification Metrics Verification metrics typically include functional correctness, test coverage, defect density, verification efficiency, and verification cost. Functional correctness is the fundamental metric, ensuring the chip executes its designed functions correctly. This is validated through functional test cases, including normal and robustness tests. Test coverage indicates the extent to which test cases cover design functionality, with higher coverage implying higher verification quality. Coverage can be further divided into code coverage, functional coverage, condition coverage, etc. Defect density measures the number of defects found in a given design scale or code volume, with lower density indicating higher design quality. Verification efficiency measures the amount of verification work completed within a given time and resource frame, with higher efficiency indicating higher productivity. Verification cost encompasses all resources required for verification, including manpower, equipment, and time, with lower costs indicating higher cost-effectiveness.\nFunctional correctness is the absolute benchmark for verification. However, in practice, it is often impossible to determine if the test plan is comprehensive and if all test spaces have been adequately covered. Therefore, a quantifiable metric is needed to guide whether verification is sufficient and when it can be concluded. This metric is commonly referred to as “test coverage.” Test coverage typically includes code coverage (lines, functions, branches) and functional coverage.\nCode Line Coverage： This indicates how many lines of the DUT design code were executed during testing.\nFunction Coverage： This indicates how many functions of the DUT design code were executed during testing.\nBranch Coverage： This indicates how many branches (if-else) of the DUT design code were executed during testing.\nFunctional Coverage： This indicates how many predefined functions were triggered during testing.\nHigh code coverage can improve the quality and reliability of verification but does not guarantee complete correctness since it cannot cover all input and state combinations. Therefore, in addition to pursuing high code coverage, other testing methods and metrics, such as functional testing, performance testing, and defect density, should be combined.\nChip Verification Management Chip verification management is a comprehensive process that encompasses all activities in the chip verification process, including the development of verification strategies, the setup of the verification environment, the writing and execution of test cases, the collection and analysis of results, and the tracking and resolution of issues and defects. The goal of chip verification management is to ensure that the chip design meets all functional and performance requirements, as well as specifications and standards.\nIn chip verification management, the first step is to formulate a detailed verification strategy, including objectives, scope, methods, and schedules. Then, a suitable verification environment must be set up, including hardware, software tools, and test data. Next, a series of test cases covering all functional and performance points must be written and executed, with results collected and analyzed to identify problems and defects. Finally, these issues and defects need to be tracked and fixed until all test cases pass.\nChip verification management is a complex process requiring a variety of skills and knowledge, including chip design, testing methods, and project management. It requires close collaboration with other activities, such as chip design, production, and sales, to ensure the quality and performance of the chip. The effectiveness of chip verification management directly impacts the success of the chip and the company’s competitiveness. Therefore, chip verification management is a crucial part of the chip development process.\nThe chip verification management process can be based on a “project management platform” and a “bug management platform,” with platform-based management typically being significantly more efficient than manual management.\nCurrent State of Chip Verification Currently, chip verification is typically completed within chip design companies. This process is not only technically complex but also entails significant costs. Given the close relationship between acceptance and design, chip verification inevitably involves the source code of the chip design. However, chip design companies usually consider the source code as a trade secret, necessitating internal personnel to perform the verification, making outsourcing difficult.\nThe importance of chip verification lies in ensuring that the designed chip operates reliably under various conditions. Verification is not only for meeting technical specifications but also for addressing the growing complexity and emerging technology demands. As the semiconductor industry evolves, the workload of chip verification has been continuously increasing, especially for complex chips, where verification work has exceeded design work, accounting for more than 70%. This means that in terms of engineer personnel ratio, verification engineers are usually twice the number of design engineers (e.g., in a team of three thousand at Zeku, there are about one thousand design engineers and two thousand verification engineers. Similar or higher ratios apply to other large chip design companies).\nDue to the specificity of verification work, which requires access to the chip design source code, it significantly limits the possibility of outsourcing chip verification. The source code is considered the company’s core trade secret, involving technical details and innovations, thus making it legally and securely unfeasible to share with external parties. Consequently, internal personnel must shoulder the verification work, increasing the internal workload and costs.\nGiven the current situation, the demand for chip verification engineers continues to grow. They need a solid technical background, familiarity with various verification tools and methods, and keen insight into emerging technologies. Due to the complexity of verification work, verification teams typically need a large scale, contrasting sharply with the design team size.\nTo meet this challenge, the industry may need to continuously explore innovative verification methods and tools to improve efficiency and reduce costs.\nSummary: Complex Chip Verification Costs High Verification Workload： For complex chips, verification work accounts for over 70% of the entire chip design work.\nHigh Labor Costs： The number of verification engineers is twice that of design engineers, with complex tasks requiring thousands of engineers.\nInternal Verification： To ensure trade secrets (chip design code) are not leaked, chip design companies can only hire a large number of verification engineers to perform verification work internally.\nCrowdsourcing Chip Verification In contrast to hardware, the software field has already made testing outsourcing (subcontracting) a norm to reduce testing costs. This business is highly mature, with a market size in the billions of yuan, advancing towards the trillion-yuan scale. From the content perspective, software testing and hardware verification share significant similarities (different targets with the same system objective). Is it feasible to subcontract hardware verification in the same way as software?\nCrowdsourcing chip verification faces many challenges, such as: Small Number of Practitioners： Compared to the software field, the number of hardware developers is several orders of magnitude smaller. For instance, according to GitHub statistics (https://madnight.github.io/githut/#/pull_requests/2023/2), traditional software programming languages (Python, Java, C++, Go) account for nearly 50%, whereas hardware description languages like Verilog account for only 0.076%, reflecting the disparity in developer numbers.\nCommercial Verification Tools： The verification tools used in enterprises (simulators, formal verification, data analysis) are almost all commercial tools, which are nearly invisible to ordinary people and difficult to self-learn.\nLack of Open Learning Materials： Chip verification involves accessing the chip design source code, which is typically regarded as the company’s trade secrets and proprietary technology. Chip design companies may be unwilling to disclose detailed verification processes and techniques, limiting the availability of learning materials.\nFeasibility Analysis Although the chip verification field has been relatively closed, from a technical perspective, adopting a subcontracting approach for verification is a feasible option due to several factors:\nFirstly, with the gradual increase of open-source chip projects, the source code involved in verification has become more open and transparent. These open-source projects do not have concerns about trade secrets in their design and verification process, providing more possibilities for learning and research. Even if some projects involve trade secrets, encryption and other methods can be used to hide design codes, addressing trade secret issues to a certain extent and making verification easier to achieve.\nSecondly, many fundamental verification tools have emerged in the chip verification field, such as Verilator and SystemC. These tools provide robust support for verification engineers, helping them perform verification work more efficiently. These tools alleviate some of the complexity and difficulty of the verification process, providing a more feasible technical foundation for adopting subcontracted verification methods.\nIn the open-source software field, some successful cases can be referenced. For example, the Linux kernel verification process adopts a subcontracting approach, with different developers and teams responsible for verifying different modules, ultimately forming a complete system. Similarly, in the machine learning field, the ImageNet project adopted a crowdsourced annotation strategy, completing large-scale image annotation tasks through crowdsourcing. These cases provide successful experiences for the chip verification field, proving the potential of subcontracted verification to improve efficiency and reduce costs.\nTherefore, despite the chip verification field being relatively closed compared to other technical fields, technological advances and the increase of open-source projects offer new possibilities for adopting subcontracted verification. By drawing on successful experiences from other fields and utilizing existing verification tools, we can promote the application of more open and efficient verification methods in chip verification, further advancing the industry. This openness and flexibility in technology will provide more choices for verification engineers, promoting innovative and diverse development in the chip verification field.\nTechnical Route To overcome challenges and engage more people in chip verification, this project continuously attempts the following technical directions:\nProvide Multi-language Verification Tools： Traditional chip verification is based on the System Verilog programming language, which has a small user base. To allow other software development/testing professionals to participate in chip verification, this project provides multi-language verification conversion tools Picker, enabling verifiers to use familiar programming languages (e.g., C++, Python, Java, Go) with open-source verification tools.\nProvide Verification Learning Materials： The scarcity of chip verification learning materials is mainly due to the improbability of commercial companies disclosing internal data. Therefore, this project will continuously update learning materials, allowing verifiers to learn the necessary skills online for free.\nProvide Real Chip Verification Cases： To make the learning materials more practical, this project uses the “Xiangshan Kunming Lake (an industrial-grade high-performance RISC-V processor) IP core” as a basis, continuously updating verification cases by extracting modules from it.\nOrganize Chip Design Subcontracted Verification： Applying what is learned is the goal of every learner. Therefore, this project periodically organizes subcontracted chip design verification, allowing everyone (whether you are a university student, verification expert, software developer, tester, or high school student) to participate in real chip design work.\nThe goal of this project is to achieve the following vision: “Open the black box of traditional verification modes, allowing anyone interested to participate in chip verification anytime, anywhere, using their preferred programming language.”\n","categories":"","description":"Basic concepts of chip verification\n","excerpt":"Basic concepts of chip verification\n","ref":"/mlvp/en/docs/basic/ic_verify/","tags":"","title":"Chip Verification"},{"body":"Verification Report https://github.com/yzcccccccccc/XS-MLVP-NutShellCache/blob/master/report/nutshell_cache_report_demo.pdf\nVerification Environment \u0026 Test Case Code https://github.com/yzcccccccccc/XS-MLVP-NutShellCache\n","categories":["Example Projects","Tutorials"],"description":"Verification of Nutshell Cache using Python.","excerpt":"Verification of Nutshell Cache using Python.","ref":"/mlvp/en/docs/advance_case/nutshellcache/","tags":["examples","docs"],"title":"Complete Verification of Nutshell Cache"},{"body":" This page will briefly introduce what verification is, as well as concepts used in the examples, such as DUT (Design Under Test) and RM (Reference Model).\nChip Verification Chip verification is a crucial step to ensure the correctness and reliability of chip designs, including functional verification, formal verification, and physical verification. This material only covers functional verification, focusing on simulation-based chip functional verification. The processes and methods of chip functional verification have many similarities with software testing, such as unit testing, system testing, black-box testing, and white-box testing. They also share similar metrics, such as functional coverage and code coverage. In essence, apart from the different tools and programming languages used, their goals and processes are almost identical. Thus, software test engineers should be able to perform chip verification without considering the tools and programming languages. However, in practice, software testing and chip verification are two completely separate fields, primarily due to the different verification tools and languages, making it difficult for software test engineers to crossover. In chip verification, hardware description languages (e.g., Verilog or SystemVerilog) and specialized commercial tools for circuit simulation are commonly used. Hardware description languages differ from high-level software programming languages like C++/Python, featuring a unique “clock” characteristic, which poses a high learning curve for software engineers.\nTo bridge the gap between chip verification and traditional software testing, allowing more people to participate in chip verification, this project provides the following content:\nMulti-language verification tools (Picker), allowing users to use their preferred programming language for chip verification. Verification framework (MLVP), enabling functional verification without worrying about the clock.\nIntroduction to basic circuits and verification knowledge, helping software enthusiasts understand circuit characteristics more easily.\nBasic learning materials for fundamental verification knowledge.\nReal high-performance chip verification cases, allowing enthusiasts to participate in verification work remotely.\nBasic Terms DUT: Design Under Test, usually referring to the designed RTL code.\nRM: Reference Model, a standard error-free model corresponding to the unit under test.\nRTL: Register Transfer Level, typically referring to the Verilog or VHDL code corresponding to the chip design.\nCoverage: The percentage of the test range relative to the entire requirement range. In chip verification, this typically includes line coverage, function coverage, and functional coverage.\nDV: Design Verification, referring to the collaboration of design and verification.\nDifferential Testing (difftest): Selecting two (or more) functionally identical units under test, submitting the same test cases that meet the unit’s requirements to observe whether there are differences in the execution results.\nTool Introduction The core tool used in this material is Picker（https://github.com/XS-MLVP/picker）. Its purpose is to automatically provide high-level programming language interfaces (Python/C++) for RTL-written design modules. Based on this tool, verification personnel with a software development (testing) background can perform chip verification without learning hardware description languages like Verilog/VHDL.\nSystem Requirements Recommended operating system: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS\nIn the development and research of system architecture, Linux is the most commonly used platform, mainly because Linux has a rich set of software and tool resources. Due to its open-source nature, important tools and software (such as Verilator) can be easily developed for Linux. In this course, multi-language verification tools like Picker and Swig can run stably on Linux.

We will use the environment generated by the Picker tool as the basic verification environment. Next, we will introduce the Picker tool and its basic usage.\nIntroduction to Picker Picker is an auxiliary tool for chip verification with two main functions:\nPackaging RTL Design Verification Modules: Picker can package RTL design verification modules (.v/.scala/.sv) into dynamic libraries and provide programming interfaces in various high-level languages (currently supporting C++, Python, Java, Scala, Golang) to drive the circuit.\nAutomatic UVM-TLM Code Generation: Picker can automate TLM code encapsulation based on the UVM sequence_item provided by the user, providing a communication interface between UVM and other high-level languages such as Python.\nThis tool allows users to perform chip unit testing based on existing software testing frameworks such as pytest, junit, TestNG, go test, etc. Advantages of Verification Using Picker:\nNo RTL Design Leakage: After conversion by Picker, the original design files (.v) are transformed into binary files (.so). Verification can still be performed without the original design files, and the verifier cannot access the RTL source code.\nReduced Compilation Time: When the DUT (Design Under Test) is stable, it only needs to be compiled once (packaged into a .so file).\nWide User Base: With support for multiple programming interfaces, it caters to developers of various languages.\nUtilization of a Rich Software Ecosystem: Supports ecosystems such as Python3, Java, Golang, etc.\nAutomated UVM Transaction Encapsulation: Enables communication between UVM and Python through automated UVM transaction encapsulation.\nRTL Simulators Currently Supported by Picker:\nVerilator\nSynopsys VCS Working Principle of Picker The main function of Picker is to convert Verilog code into C++ or Python code. For example, using a processor developed with Chisel: first, it is converted into Verilog code through Chisel’s built-in tools, and then Picker provides high-level programming language interfaces.\nPython Module Generation Process of Module Generation Picker exports Python modules based on C++.\nPicker is a code generation tool. It first generates project files and then uses make to compile them into binary files.\nPicker first uses a simulator to compile the RTL code into a C++ class and then compiles it into a dynamic library (see the C++ steps for details).\nUsing the Swig tool, Picker then exports the dynamic library as a Python module based on the C++ header file definitions generated in the previous step.\nFinally, the generated module is exported to a directory, with other intermediate files being either cleaned up or retained as needed.\nSwig is a tool used to export C/C++ code to other high-level languages. It parses C++ header files and generates corresponding intermediate code. For detailed information on the generation process, please refer to the Swig official documentation . For information on how Picker generates C++ classes, please refer to C++ .\nThe generated module can be imported and used by other Python programs, with a file structure similar to that of standard Python modules. Using the Python Module The --language python or --lang python parameter specifies the generation of the Python base library.\nThe --example, -e parameter generates an executable file containing an example project.\nThe --verbose, -v parameter preserves intermediate files generated during project creation.\nUsing the Tool to Generate Python’s DUT Class Using the simple adder example from Case One:\nPicker automatically generates a base class in Python, referred to as the DUT class. For the adder example, the user needs to write test cases, importing the Python module generated in the previous section and calling its methods to operate on the hardware module. The directory structure is as follows: picker_out_adder |-- UT_Adder # Project generated by Picker tool | |-- Adder.fst.hier | |-- _UT_Adder.so | |-- __init__.py | |-- libDPIAdder.a | |-- libUTAdder.so | `-- libUT_Adder.py `-- example.py # User-written code The DUTAdder class has a total of eight methods, as shown below: class DUTAdder: def InitClock(name: str) # Initialize clock, with the clock pin name as a parameter, e.g., clk def Step(i: int = 1) # Advance the circuit by i cycles def StepRis(callback: Callable, args=None, args=(), kwargs={}) # Set rising edge callback function def StepFal(callback: Callable, args=None, args=(), kwargs={}) # Set falling edge callback function def SetWaveform(filename) # Set waveform file def SetCoverage(filename) # Set code coverage file def RefreshComb() # Advance combinational circuit def Finish() # Destroy the circuit Pins corresponding to the DUT, such as reset and clock, are represented as member variables in the DUTAdder class. As shown below, pin values can be read and written via the value attribute. from UT_Adder import * dut = DUTAdder() dut.a.value = 1 # Assign value to the pin by setting the .value attribute dut.a[12] = 1 # Assign value to the 12th bit of the input pin a x = dut.a.value # Read the value of pin a y = dut.a[12] # Read the 12th bit of pin a General Flow for Driving DUT Create DUT and Set Pin Modes: By default, pins are assigned values on the rising edge of the next cycle. For combinational logic, you need to set the assignment mode to immediate assignment.\nInitialize the Clock: This binds the clock pin to the internal xclock of the DUT. Combinational logic does not require a clock and can be ignored.\nReset the Circuit: Most sequential circuits need to be reset.\nWrite Data to DUT Input Pins: Use the pin.Set(x) interface or pin.value = x for assignment.\nDrive the Circuit: Use Step for sequential circuits and RefreshComb for combinational circuits.\nObtain and Check Outputs of DUT Pins: For example, compare the results with a reference model using assertions.\nComplete Verification and Destroy DUT: Calling Finish() will write waveform, coverage, and other information to files.\nThe corresponding pseudocode is as follows:\nfrom UT_DUT import * # 1 Create dut = DUT() # 2 Initialize dut.SetWaveform(\"test.fst\") dut.InitClock(\"clock\") # 3 Reset dut.reset = 1 dut.Step(1) dut.reset = 0 dut.Step(1) # 4 Input Data dut.input_pin1.value = 0x123123 dut.input_pin3.value = \"0b1011\" # 5 Drive the Circuit dut.Step(1) # 6 Get Results x = dut.output_pin.value print(\"result:\", x) # 7 Destroy dut.Finish() Other Data Types In general, most DUT verification tasks can be accomplished using the interfaces provided by the DUT class. However, for special cases, additional interfaces are needed, such as custom clocks, asynchronous operations, advancing combinational circuits and writing waveforms, and modifying pin properties. In the DUT class generated by Picker, in addition to XData type pin member variables , there are also XClock type xclock and XPort type xport .\nclass DUTAdder(object): xport: XPort # Member variable xport for managing all pins in the DUT xclock: XClock # Member variable xclock for managing the clock # DUT Pins a: XData b: XData cin: XData cout: XData XData Class Data in DUT pins usually have an uncertain bit width and can be in one of four states: 0, 1, Z, and X. Picker provides XData to represent pin data in the circuit. Main Methods class XData: # Split XData, for example, create a separate XData for bits 7-10 of a 32-bit XData # name: Name, start: Start bit, width: Bit width, e.g., auto sub = a.SubDataRef(\"sub_pin\", 0, 4) def SubDataRef(name, start, width): XData def GetWriteMode(): WriteMode # Get the write mode of XData: Imme (immediate), Rise (rising edge), Fall (falling edge) def SetWriteMode(mode: WriteMode) # Set the write mode of XData, e.g., a.SetWriteMode(WriteMode::Imme) def DataValid(): bool # Check if the data is valid (returns false if value contains X or Z states, otherwise true) def W(): int # Get the bit width of XData (0 indicates XData is of Verilog's logic type, otherwise it's the width of Vec type) def U(): int # Get the unsigned value of XData (e.g., x = a.value) def S(): int # Get the signed value of XData def String(): str # Convert XData to a hexadecimal string, e.g., \"0x123ff\", if ? appears, it means X or Z state in the corresponding 4 bits def Equal(xdata): bool # Compare two XData instances for equality def Set(value) # Assign value to XData, value can be XData, string, int, bytes, etc. def GetBytes(): bytes # Get the value of XData in bytes format def Connect(xdata): bool # Connect two XData instances; only In and Out types can be connected. When Out data changes, In type XData will be automatically updated. def IsInIO(): bool # Check if XData is of In type, which can be read and written def IsOutIO(): bool # Check if XData is of Out type, which is read-only def IsBiIO(): bool # Check if XData is of Bi type, which can be read and written def IsImmWrite(): bool # Check if XData is in Imm write mode def IsRiseWrite(): bool # Check if XData is in Rise write mode def IsFallWrite(): bool # Check if XData is in Fall write mode def AsImmWrite() # Change XData's write mode to Imm def AsRiseWrite() # Change XData's write mode to Rise def AsFallWrite() # Change XData's write mode to Fall def AsBiIO() # Change XData to Bi type def AsInIO() # Change XData to In type def AsOutIO() # Change XData to Out type def FlipIOType() # Invert the IO type of XData, e.g., In to Out or Out to In def Invert() # Invert the data in XData def At(index): PinBind # Get the pin at index, e.g., x = a.At(12).Get() or a.At(12).Set(1) def AsBinaryString() # Convert XData's data to a binary string, e.g., \"1001011\" To simplify assignment operations, XData has overloaded property assignment for Set(value) and U() methods, allowing assignments and retrievals with pin.value = x and x = pin.value.\n# Access with .value # a is of XData type a.value = 12345 # Decimal assignment a.value = 0b11011 # Binary assignment a.value = 0o12345 # Octal assignment a.value = 0x12345 # Hexadecimal assignment a.value = -1 # Assign all bits to 1, a.value = x is equivalent to a.Set(x) a[31] = 0 # Assign value to bit 31 a.value = \"x\" # Assign high impedance state a.value = \"z\" # Assign unknown state x = a.value # Retrieve value, equivalent to x = a.U() XPort Class Directly operating on XData is clear and intuitive when dealing with a few pins. However, managing multiple XData instances can be cumbersome. XPort is a wrapper around XData that allows centralized management of multiple XData instances. It also provides methods for convenient batch management. Initialization and Adding Pins port = XPort(\"p\") # Create an XPort instance with prefix p Main Methods\nclass XPort: def XPort(prefix = \"\") # Create a port with prefix prefix, e.g., p = XPort(\"tile_link_\") def PortCount(): int # Get the number of pins in the port (i.e., number of bound XData instances) def Add(pin_name, XData) # Add a pin, e.g., p.Add(\"reset\", dut.reset) def Del(pin_name) # Delete a pin def Connect(xport2) # Connect two ports def NewSubPort(std::string subprefix): XPort # Create a sub-port with all pins starting with subprefix def Get(key, raw_key = False): XData # Get XData def SetZero() # Set all XData in the port to 0 XClock Class XClock is a wrapper for the circuit clock used to drive the circuit. In traditional simulation tools (e.g., Verilator), you need to manually assign values to clk and update the state using functions like step_eval. Our tool provides methods to bind the clock directly to XClock, allowing the Step() method to simultaneously update the clk and circuit state. Initialization and Adding Pins # Initialization clk = XClock(stepfunc) # Parameter stepfunc is the circuit advancement method provided by DUT backend, e.g., Verilator's step_eval Main Methods\nclass XClock: def Add(xdata) # Bind Clock with xdata, e.g., clock.Add(dut.clk) def Add(xport) # Bind Clock with XData def RefreshComb() # Advance circuit state without advancing time or dumping waveform def RefreshCombT() # Advance circuit state (advance time and dump waveform) def Step(int s = 1) # Advance the circuit by s clock cycles, DUT.Step = DUT.xclock.Step def StepRis(func, args=(), kwargs={}) ","categories":["Tutorial"],"description":"Basic usage of the verification tool.","excerpt":"Basic usage of the verification tool.","ref":"/mlvp/en/docs/env_usage/picker_usage/","tags":["docs"],"title":"Tool Introduction"},{"body":"Principle Introduction Basic Library In this chapter, we will introduce how to use Picker to compile RTL code into a C++ class and compile it into a dynamic library.\nFirst, the Picker tool parses the RTL code, creates a new module based on the specified Top Module, encapsulates the module’s input and output ports, and exports DPI/API to operate the input ports and read the output ports.\nThe tool determines the module to be encapsulated by specifying the file and Module Name of the Top Module. At this point, you can understand Top as the main function in software programming.\nNext, the Picker tool uses the specified simulator to compile the RTL code and generate a DPI library file. This library file contains the logic required to simulate running the RTL code (i.e., the hardware simulator).\nFor VCS, this library file is a .so (dynamic library) file, and for Verilator, it is a .a (static library) file. DPI stands for Direct Programming Interface，which can be understood as an API specification.\nThen, the Picker tool renders the base class defined in the source code according to the configuration parameters, generates a base class (wrapper) for interfacing with the simulator and hides simulator details, and links the base class with the DPI library file to generate a UT dynamic library file.\nAt this point, the UT library file uses the unified API provided by the Picker tool template. Compared with the simulator-specific API in the DPI library file, the UT library file provides a unified API interface for the hardware simulator generated by the simulator. The generated UT library file is common across different languages! Unless otherwise specified, other high-level languages will operate the hardware simulator by calling the UT dynamic library. Finally, based on the configuration parameters and parsed RTL code, the Picker tool generates a C++ class source code. This source code is the definition (.hpp) and implementation (.cpp) of the RTL hardware module in the software. Instantiating this class is equivalent to creating a hardware module.\nThis class inherits from the base class and implements the pure virtual functions in the base class to instantiate the hardware in software. There are two reasons for not encapsulating this class implementation into the dynamic library:\nSince the UT library file needs to be common across different languages, and different languages have different ways to implement classes, for universality, the class implementation is not encapsulated into the dynamic library. To facilitate debugging, enhance code readability, and make it easier for users to repackage and modify. Generating Executable Files In this chapter, we will introduce how to write test cases and generate executable files based on the basic library generated in the previous chapter (including dynamic libraries, class declarations, and definitions).\nFirst, users need to write test cases, which means instantiating the class generated in the previous chapter and calling the methods in the class to operate the hardware module. Details can be found in [Random Number Generator Verification - Configure Test Code](docs/quick-start/examples/rmg/#Configure Test Code) for instantiation and initialization process.\nSecond, users need to apply different linking parameters to generate executable files based on the different simulators applied in the basic library. The corresponding parameters are defined in template/cpp/cmake/*.cmake.\nFinally, according to the configured linking parameters, the compiler will link the basic library and generate an executable file.\nTaking Adder Verification as an example, picker_out_adder/cpp/cmake/*.cmake is a copy of the template described in item 2 above. vcs.cmake defines the linking parameters of the basic library generated using the VCS simulator, and verilator.cmake defines the linking parameters of the basic library generated using the Verilator simulator.\nUsage The parameter --language cpp or -l cpp is used to specify the generation of the C++ basic library. The parameter -e is used to generate an executable file containing an example project. The parameter -v is used to retain intermediate files when generating the project. #include \"UT_Adder.hpp\" int64_t random_int64() { static std::random_device rd; static std::mt19937_64 generator(rd()); static std::uniform_int_distribution\u003cint64_t\u003e distribution(INT64_MIN, INT64_MAX); return distribution(generator); } int main() { #if defined(USE_VCS) UTAdder *dut = new UTAdder(\"libDPIAdder.so\"); #elif defined(USE_VERILATOR) UTAdder *dut = new UTAdder(); #endif // dut-\u003einitClock(dut-\u003eclock); dut-\u003exclk.Step(1); printf(\"Initialized UTAdder\\n\"); struct input_t { uint64_t a; uint64_t b; uint64_t cin; }; struct output_t { uint64_t sum; uint64_t cout; }; for (int c = 0; c \u003c 114514; c++) { input_t i; output_t o_dut, o_ref; i.a = random_int64(); i.b = random_int64(); i.cin = random_int64() \u0026 1; auto dut_cal = [\u0026]() { dut-\u003ea = i.a; dut-\u003eb = i.b; dut-\u003ecin = i.cin; dut-\u003exclk.Step(1); o_dut.sum = (uint64_t)dut-\u003esum; o_dut.cout = (uint64_t)dut-\u003ecout; }; auto ref_cal = [\u0026]() { uint64_t sum = i.a + i.b; bool carry = sum \u003c i.a; sum += i.cin; carry = carry || sum \u003c i.cin; o_ref.sum = sum; o_ref.cout = carry ; }; dut_cal(); ref_cal(); printf(\"[cycle %llu] a=0x%lx, b=0x%lx, cin=0x%lx\\n\", dut-\u003exclk.clk, i.a, i.b, i.cin); printf(\"DUT: sum=0x%lx, cout=0x%lx\\n\", o_dut.sum, o_dut.cout); printf(\"REF: sum=0x%lx, cout=0x%lx\\n\", o_ref.sum, o_ref.cout); Assert(o_dut.sum == o_ref.sum, \"sum mismatch\"); } delete dut; printf(\"Test Passed, destory UTAdder\\n\"); return 0; } Generating Waveforms In C++, the destructor of the DUT automatically calls dut.finalize(), so you only need to delete dut after the test ends to perform post-processing (write waveform, coverage files, etc.).\n#include \"UT_Adder.hpp\" int main() { UTAdder *dut = new UTAdder(\"libDPIAdder.so\"); printf(\"Initialized UTAdder\\n\"); for (int c = 0; c \u003c 114514; c++) { auto dut_cal = [\u0026]() { dut-\u003ea = c * 2; dut-\u003eb = c / 2; dut-\u003ecin = i.cin; dut-\u003exclk.Step(1); o_dut.sum = (uint64_t)dut-\u003esum; o_dut.cout = (uint64_t)dut-\u003ecout; }; dut_cal(); printf(\"[cycle %llu] a=0x%lx, b=0x%lx, cin=0x%lx\\n\", dut-\u003exclk.clk, i.a, i.b, i.cin); printf(\"DUT: sum=0x%lx, cout=0x%lx\\n\", o_dut.sum, o_dut.cout); } delete dut; // automatically call dut.finalize() in ~UTAdder() printf(\"Simulation finished\\n\"); return 0; } ","categories":["Tutorials"],"description":"Encapsulate the DUT hardware runtime environment with C++ and compile it into a dynamic library.","excerpt":"Encapsulate the DUT hardware runtime environment with C++ and compile …","ref":"/mlvp/en/docs/multi-lang/cpp/","tags":["docs"],"title":"Using C++"},{"body":"源码安装Picker工具 依赖安装 cmake ( \u003e=3.11 ) gcc ( 支持c++20,至少为gcc版本10, 建议11及以上 ) python3 ( \u003e=3.8 ) verilator ( ==4.218 ) verible-verilog-format ( \u003e=0.0-3428-gcfcbb82b ) swig ( \u003e=4.2.0, 用于多语言支持 ) 请注意，请确保verible-verilog-format等工具的路径已经添加到环境变量$PATH中，可以直接命令行调用。\n下载源码 git clone https://github.com/XS-MLVP/picker.git cd picker make init 构建并安装 cd picker make # 可通过 make BUILD_XSPCOMM_SWIG=python,java,scala,golang 开启其他语言支持。 # 各语言需要自己的开发环境，需要自行配置，例如javac等 sudo -E make install 默认的安装的目标路径是 /usr/local， 二进制文件被置于 /usr/local/bin，模板文件被置于 /usr/local/share/picker。 安装时会自动安装 xspcomm基础库（https://github.com/XS-MLVP/xcomm），该基础库是用于封装 RTL 模块的基础类型，位于 /usr/local/lib/libxspcomm.so。 可能需要手动设置编译时的链接目录参数(-L) 如果开启了Java等语言支持，还会安装 xspcomm 对应的多语言软件包。\n安装测试 执行命令并检查输出：\npicker export –help\nExport RTL Projects Sources as Software libraries such as C++/Python Usage: picker export [OPTIONS] file Positionals: file TEXT REQUIRED DUT .v/.sv source file, contain the top module Options: -h,--help Print this help message and exit --fs,--filelist TEXT DUT .v/.sv source files, contain the top module, split by comma.

为满足开放验证的环境要求，我们开发了 Picker 工具，用于将 RTL 设计转换为多语言接口，并在此基础上进行验证，我们将会使用 Picker 工具生成的环境作为基础的验证环境。接下来我们将介绍 Picker 工具，及其基础的使用方法。\nPicker 简介 picker 是一个芯片验证辅助工具，具有两个主要功能：\n打包RTL设计验证模块： picker 可以将 RTL 设计验证模块（.v/.scala/.sv）打包成动态库，并提供多种高级语言（目前支持 C++、Python、Java、Scala、Golang）的编程接口来驱动电路。 UVM-TLM代码自动生成： picker 能够基于用户提供的 UVM sequence_item 进行自动化的 TLM 代码封装，提供 UVM 与其他高级语言（如 Python）的通信接口。 该工具允许用户基于现有的软件测试框架，例如 pytest、junit、TestNG、go test 等，进行芯片单元测试。 基于 Picker 进行验证的优点:\n不泄露 RTL 设计：经过 Picker 转换后，原始的设计文件（.v）被转化成了二进制文件（.so），脱离原始设计文件后，依旧可进行验证，且验证者无法获取 RTL 源代码。 减少编译时间：当 DUT（设计待测）稳定时，只需要编译一次（打包成 .so 文件）。 用户范围广：提供的编程接口多，覆盖不同语言的开发者。 使用丰富的软件生态：支持 Python3、Java、Golang 等生态系统。 自动化的 UVM 事务封装：通过自动化封装 UVM 事务，实现 UVM 和 Python 的通信。 Picker 目前支持的 RTL 仿真器：\nVerilator Synopsys VCS Picker的工作原理\nPicker的主要功能就是将Verilog代码转换为C++或者Python代码，以Chisel开发的处理器为例:先通过Chisel自带的工具将其转换为Verilog代码，再通Picker提供高级编程语言接口。\nPython 模块生成 生成模块的过程 Picker 导出 Python Module 的方式是基于 C++ 的。\nPicker 是 代码生成(codegen)工具，它会先生成项目文件，再利用 make 编译出二进制文件。 Picker 首先会利用仿真器将 RTL 代码编译为 C++ Class，并编译为动态库。（见C++步骤详情） 再基于 Swig 工具，利用上一步生成的 C++ 的头文件定义，将动态库导出为 Python Module。 最终将生成的模块导出到目录，并按照需求清理或保留其他中间文件。 Swig 是一个用于将 C/C++ 导出为其他高级语言的工具。该工具会解析 C++ 头文件，并生成对应的中间代码。 如果希望详细了解生成过程，请参阅 Swig 官方文档。 如果希望知道 Picker 如何生成 C++ Class，请参阅 C++。\n该这个模块和标准的 Python 模块一样，可以被其他 Python 程序导入并调用，文件结构也与普通 Python 模块无异。 Python 模块使用 参数 --language python 或 --lang python 用于指定生成Python基础库。 参数 --example, -e 用于生成包含示例项目的可执行文件。 参数 --verbose, -v 用于保留生成项目时的中间文件。 使用工具生成Python的DUT类 以案例一中的简单加法器为例：\nPicker会自动生成Python的一个基础类，我们称之为DUT类，以前加法器为例，用户需要编写测试用例，即导入上一章节生成的 Python Module，并调用其中的方法，以实现对硬件模块的操作。 目录结构为： picker_out_adder |-- UT_Adder # Picker 工具生成的项目 | |-- Adder.fst.hier | |-- _UT_Adder.so | |-- __init__.py | |-- libDPIAdder.a | |-- libUTAdder.so | `-- libUT_Adder.py `-- example.py # 用户需要编写的代码 在DUT对应的DUTAdder类中共有8个方法，具体如下： class DUTAdder: def InitClock(name: str) # 初始化时钟，参数时钟引脚对应的名称，例如clk def Step(i:int = 1) # 推进电路i个周期 def StepRis(callback: Callable, args=None, args=(), kwargs={}) # 设置上升沿回调函数 def StepFal(callback: Callable, args=None, args=(), kwargs={}) # 设置下降沿回调函数 def SetWaveform(filename) # 设置波形文件 def SetCoverage(filename) # 设置代码覆盖率文件 def RefreshComb() # 推进组合电路 def Finish() # 销毁电路 DUT对应的引脚，例如reset，clock等在DUTAdder类中以成员变量的形式呈现。如下所示，可以通过value进行引脚的读取和写入。 from UT_Adder import * dut = DUTAdder() dut.a.value = 1 # 通过给引脚的.value属性赋值完成对引脚的赋值 dut.a[12] = 1 # 对引脚输入a的第12bit进行赋值 x = dut.a.value # 读取引脚a的值 y = dut.a[12] # 读取引脚a的第12bit的值 驱动DUT的一般流程 创建DUT，设置引脚模式。默认情况下，引脚是在一下个周期的上升沿进行赋值，如果是组合逻辑，需要设置赋值模式为立即赋值。 初始化时钟。其目的是将时钟引脚与DUT内置的xclock进行绑定。组合逻辑没有时钟可以忽略。 reset电路。大部分时序电路都需要reset。 给DUT输入引脚写入数据。通过“pin.Set(x)”接口，或者pin.vaulue=x进行赋值。 驱动电路。时序电路用Step，组合电路用RefreshComb。 获取DUT各个引脚的输出进行检测。例如和参考模型进行的结果进行assert对比。 完成验证，销毁DUT。调用Finish()时，会把波形，覆盖率等写入到文件。 对应伪代码如下：\nfrom UT_DUT import * # 1 创建 dut = DUT() # 2 初始化 dut.SetWaveform(\"test.fst\") dut.InitClock(\"clock\") # 3 reset dut.reset = 1 dut.Step(1) dut.reset = 0 dut.Step(1) # 4 输入数据 dut.input_pin1.value = 0x123123 dut.input_pin3.value = \"0b1011\" # 5 驱动电路 dut.Step(1) # 6 得到结果 x = dut.output_pin.value print(\"result:\", x) # 7 销毁 dut.Finish() 其他数据类型 一般情况下，通过上述DUT类自带的接口就能完成绝大部分DUT的验证，但一些特殊情况需要其他对应的接口，例如自定义时钟、异步操作、推进组合电路并写入波形、修改引脚属性等。\n在picker生成的DUT类中，除了XData类型的引脚成员变量外，还有XClock类型的xclock和XPort类型的xport。\nclass DUTAdder(object): xport: XPort # 成员变量

在处理少数几个XData引脚时，直接操作XData是比较清晰和直观的。但是，当涉及到多个XData时，进行批量管理就不太方便了。XPort是对XData的一种封装，它允许我们对多个XData进行集中操作。我们还提供了一些方法来方便地进行批量管理。 初始化与添加引脚\nport = XPort(\"p\") #创建前缀为p的XPort实例 主要方法\nclass XPort: def

当安装好上述依赖后，可运行以下命令安装最新版本的 mlvp：\npip3 install mlvp@git+https://github.com/XS-MLVP/mlvp@master 或通过以下方式进行本地安装：\ngit clone https://github.com/XS-MLVP/mlvp.git cd mlvp pip3 install . 搭建简单的验证环境 我们使用一个简单的加法器示例来演示 mlvp 的使用方法，该示例位于 example/adder 目录下。\n加法器的设计如下：\nmodule Adder #( parameter WIDTH = 64 ) ( input [WIDTH-1:0] io_a, input [WIDTH-1:0] io_b, input io_cin, output [WIDTH-1:0] io_sum, output io_cout ); assign {io_cout, io_sum} = io_a + io_b + io_cin; endmodule 首先使用 picker 将其转换为 Python Package，再使用 mlvp 来为其建立验证环境。安装好依赖后，可以直接在 example/adder 目录下运行以下命令来完成转换：\nmake dut 为了验证加法器的功能，我们使用 mlvp 提供的方法来建立验证环境。\n首先需要为其创建加法器接口的驱动方法，这里用到了 Bundle 来描述需要驱动的某类接口，Agent 用于编写对该接口的驱动方法。如下所示：\nclass AdderBundle(Bundle): a, b, cin, sum, cout = Signals(5) class AdderAgent(Agent): def __init__(self, bundle): super().__init__(bundle.step) self.bundle = bundle @driver_method() async def exec_add(self, a, b, cin): self.bundle.a.value = a self.bundle.b.value = b self.bundle.cin.value = cin await self.bundle.step() return self.bundle.sum.value, self.bundle.cout.value 我们使用了 driver_method 装饰器来标记 Agent 中用于驱动的方法 exec_add，该方法完成了对加法器的一次驱动操作，每当该方法被调用，其会将输入信号 a、b、cin 的值分别赋给加法器的输入端口，并在下一个时钟周期后读取加法器的输出信号 sum 和 cout 的值并返回。\nBundle 是该 Agent 需要驱动的接口的描述。在 Bundle 中提供了一系列的连接方法来连接到 DUT 的输入输出端口。这样一来，我们可以通过此 Agent 完成所有拥有相同接口的 DUT 的驱动操作。\n为了验证加法器的功能，我们还需要为其创建一个参考模型，用于验证加法器的输出是否正确。在 mlvp 中，我们使用 Model 来定义参考模型。如下所示：\nclass AdderModel(Model): @driver_hook(agent_name=\"add_agent\") def exec_add(self, a, b, cin): result = a + b + cin sum = result \u0026 ((1 \u003c\u003c 64) - 1) cout = result \u003e\u003e 64 return sum, cout 在参考模型中，我们同样定义了一个 exec_add 方法，该方法与 Agent 中的 exec_add 方法含有相同的输入参数，我们用程序代码计算出了加法器的标准返回值。我们使用了 driver_hook 装饰器来标记该方法，以便该方法可以与 Agent 中的 exec_add 方法进行关联。\n接下来，我们需要创建一个顶层的测试环境，将上述的驱动方法与参考模型相关联，如下所示：\nclass AdderEnv(Env): def __init__(self, adder_bundle): super().__init__() self.add_agent = AdderAgent(adder_bundle) self.attach(AdderModel()) 此时，验证环境已经搭建完成，mlvp 会自动驱动参考模型并收集结果，并将结果与加法器的输出进行比对。\n之后，我们可以编写多个测试用例来验证加法器的功能，如下所示：\n@pytest.mark.mlvp_async async def test_random(mlvp_request): env = mlvp_request() for _ in range(1000): a = random.randint(0, 2**64-1) b = random.randint(0, 2**64-1) cin = random.randint(0, 1) await env.add_agent.exec_add(a, b, cin) @pytest.mark.mlvp_async async def test_boundary(mlvp_request): env = mlvp_request() for cin in [0, 1]: for a in [0, 2**64-1]: for b in [0, 2**64-1]: await env.add_agent.exec_add(a, b, cin) mlvp 集成了 pytest 框架，用户可直接使用 pytest 的功能来对测试用例进行管理。mlvp 会自动完成 dut 的驱动与参考模型的比对工作，并生成验证报告。\n可以直接在 example/adder 目录下运行以下命令来运行该示例：\nmake run 运行结束后报告将自动在reports目录下生成。\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"安装 mlvp 需要的依赖有：\nPython

芯片验证是确保芯片设计正确性和可靠性的重要环节，主要包括功能验证、形式验证和物理验证等形式，本学习材料仅仅包含对功能验证的介绍，且侧重于基于仿真器的芯片功能验证。芯片功能验证的流程和方法与软件测试有比较大的共同点，例如都有单元测试、系统测试、黑盒测试、白盒测试等。在验证指标上也有共同特点，例如功能覆盖率、代码覆盖率等等。从某种形式上说，除了使用的工具和编程语言不一样外，他们的目标和流程几乎相同。因此，在不考虑工具和编程语言的情况下，会软件测试的工程师应当就会芯片验证。 但在实际工作中，软件测试和芯片验证属于两个完全不相交的行业，其主要原因是验证工具和验证语言的不同，导致软件测试工程师很难实现跨界。在芯片验证领域，通常使用硬件描述语言进行验证（例如 Verilog 或者 System Verilog），使用专业商业工具进行电路仿真。硬件描述语言不同于C++/Python等高级软件编程语言，具有独特的“时钟”特性，对于软件领域的工程师不友好，学习成本高。\n为了打通芯片验证与传统软件测试之间的壁垒，让更多的人参与到芯片验证，本项目提供如下内容：\n多语言验证工具（Picker），让用户可以使用自己擅长的编程语言进行芯片验证 验证框架（MLVP），如何在不关心时钟的情况下进行功能验证\n介绍基本电路、验证知识，方便软件背景爱好者更能容易的理解电路特征\n提供基本学习材料，学习基本验证知识\n提供真实高性能芯片验证案例，让爱好者可以远程参与验证工作\n基本术语 DUT： DUT（Design Under Test）指待测试设计，通常指设计好的RTL代码。\nRM： Reference Model （RM）指代待测试单元对应的参考模型，参考模型通常被认为是标准的，没有错误的。\nRTL： 指寄存器传输级（Register Transfer Level），通常指代芯片设计对应的 verilog 或者 vhdl 代码。\n覆盖率： 测试覆盖率是指测试范围与整个需求范围的百分比。在芯片验证领域，通常有代码行覆盖率、函数覆盖率、功能覆盖率等。\nDV： DV中的D通常指设计（Desgin），V指验证（Verification）。何在一起指设计与验证协同工作。\n差分测试（difftest）： 选取两个（或以上）功能相同的被测对象，选取符合被测对象要求的同一测试用例分别提交被测对象进行执行，以观测执行结果是否存在差异的过程。\n工具介绍 本学习材料用到的核心工具为 picker （https://github.com/XS-MLVP/picker），它的作用是将RTL编写的设计模块自动提供高级编程语言接口（Python/C++等）。基于该工具，软件开发（测试）背景的验证人员可以不用去学习 Verilog/VHDL 等硬件描述语言进行芯片验证。\n系统需求 建议操作系统：Ubuntu 22.04 LTS\n在系统结构开发、科研的过程中，Linux 是最为常用的平台，这主要是因为 Linux 拥有丰富的软件、工具资源：由于 Linux 的开源性，各大重要工具软件（如 Verilator）可以很容易地面向 Linux 进行开发。 在本课程的实验中，多语言验证工具Picker、Swig等工具都可以在 Linux 上稳定运行。

芯片从设计到成品的过程主要包括芯片设计、芯片制造、芯片封测试三大阶段。在芯片设计中，又分前端设计和后端设计，前端设计也称之为逻辑设计，目标是让电路逻辑达到预期功能要求。后端设计也称为物理设计，主要工作是优化布局布线，减小芯片面积，降低功耗，提高频率等。芯片验证（Chip Verification）是芯片设计流程中的一个重要环节。它的目标是确保设计的芯片在功能、性能和功耗等方面都满足预定的规格。验证过程通常包括功能验证、时序验证和功耗验证等多个步骤，使用的方法和工具包括仿真、形式验证、硬件加速和原型制作等。针对本文，芯片验证仅包含对芯片前端设计的验证，验证设计的电路逻辑是否满足既定需求（“Does this proposed design do what is intended?\"），通常也称为功能验证（Functional verification），不包含功耗、频率等后端设计。\n对于芯片产品，一旦设计错误被制造出来修改成本将会非常高昂，因为可能需要召回产品，并重新制造芯片，无论是经济成本还是时间成本都十分昂贵。经典由于芯片验证不足导致失败的典型案例如下： Intel Pentium FDIV Bug：在1994年，Intel的Pentium处理器被发现存在一个严重的除法错误，这个错误被称为FDIV bug。这个错误是由于在芯片的浮点单元中，一个查找表中的几个条目错误导致的。这个错误在大多数应用中不会出现，但在一些特定的计算中会导致结果错误。由于这个错误，Intel不得不召回了大量的处理器，造成了巨大的经济损失。\nAriane 5 Rocket Failure：虽然这不是一个芯片的例子，但它展示了硬件验证的重要性。在1996年，欧洲空间局的Ariane 5火箭在发射后不久就爆炸了。原因是火箭的导航系统中的一个64位浮点数被转换为16位整数时溢出，导致系统崩溃。这个错误在设计阶段没有被发现，导致了火箭的失败。\nAMD Barcelona Bug：在2007年，AMD的Barcelona处理器被发现存在一个严重的转译查找缓冲（TLB）错误。这个错误会导致系统崩溃或者重启。AMD不得不通过降低处理器的频率和发布BIOS更新来解决这个问题，这对AMD的声誉和财务状况造成了重大影响。\n这些案例都强调了芯片验证的重要性。如果在设计阶段就能发现并修复这些错误，那么就可以避免这些昂贵的失败。验证不足的案例不仅发生在过去，也发生在现在，例如某新入局 ASIC 芯片市场的互联网企业打造一款 55 纳米芯片，极力追求面积缩减并跳过验证环节，最终导致算法失败，三次流片皆未通过测试，平均每次流片失败导致企业损失约 50 万美元。\n芯片验证流程 芯片设计和验证的耦合关系如上图所示，设计和验证有同样的输入，即规范文档（specification）。参考规范，设计与验证人员双方按照各自的理解，以及各自的需求进行独立编码实现。设计方需要满足的前提是编码的RTL代码“可综合”，需要考虑电路特性，而验证方一般只要考虑功能是否满足要求，编码限制少。双方完成模块开发后，需要进行健全性对比测试（Sanity Test），判定功能是否表现一致，若不一致需要进行协同排查，确定问题所在并进行修复，再进行对比测试，直到所有功能点都满足预期。由于芯片设计和芯片验证耦合度很高，因此有些企业在研发队伍上也进行了直接耦合，为每个子模块的设计团队都配置了对应的验证团队（DV）。上图中的设计与验证的耦合流程为粗粒度的关系，具体到具体芯片（例如Soc、DDR）、具体企业等都有其适合自身的合作模式。\n在上述对比测试中，设计方的产出的模块通常称为DUT（Design Under Test），验证方开发的模型通常称为RM（Reference Model）。针对图中的验证工作，按照流程可以有：编写验证计划、创建验证平台、整理功能点、构建测试用例、运行调试、收集Bug/覆盖率、回归测试、编写测试报告等多个阶段。\n验证计划： 验证计划描述了如何进行验证，以及如何保证验证质量，达到功能验证要求。在文档结构上通常包含验证目标，验证策略、验证环境、验证项、验证过程、风险防范、资源及时间表、结果和报告等部分。验证目标明确需要验证的功能或性能指标，这些目标应该直接从芯片的规范文档中提取。验证策略描述如何进行验证，包括可能使用的验证方法，例如仿真、形式化、FPGA加速等，以及如何组织验证任务。验证环境用于描述具体的测试环境，例如验证工具类型，版本号等。验证项包含了需要验证的具体项以及预期结果。验证计划可以有总计划，也可以针对具体验证的子任务进行编写。\n平台搭建： 验证平台是具体验证任务的执行环境，同一类验证任务可以使用相同的验证平台。验证平台的搭建是验证流程中的关键步骤、具体包含验证工具选择（例如是采用软件仿真，还是采用形式化验证，或者硬件加速）、环境配置（例如配置服务器环境，FPGA环境）、创建测试环境、基本测试案例等。创建好基本测试平台，跑通基本测试案例，也通常称为“冒烟测试”。后继具体的测试代码，都将基于该测试平台进行，因此测试平台需要具有可重用性。验证平台通常包含测试框架和被测试代码，以及对应的基本信号激励。\n功能点整理： 根据规范手册（spec）列出DUT的基本功能，并对其进行明确的描述，以及如何对该功能点进行测试。功能点整理过程中，需要根据重要性、风险、复杂性等因数对其进行优先级排序。功能点整理还需要对各个功能点进行追踪和状态，如果发现原始功能点有更新需要及时进行对应计划的同步。\n测试用例： 测试用例是指一组条件或变量，用于确定DUT是否满足特定需求并能正确运行。每个测试用例通常包含测试条件，输入数据，预期结果，实际结果和测试结果。通过运行测试用例并比较预期结果和实际结果，可以确定系统或应用是否正确实现了特定的功能或需求。在芯片验证中，测试用例是用来验证芯片设计是否满足规格要求的重要工具。\n编码实现： 编码实现即测试用例的具体执行过程，包括测试数据生成、测试框架选择、编程语言选择、参考模型编写等。编码实现是对功能点和测试用例充分理解后工作，如果理解不到位，可能导致DUT无法驱动，不能发现潜在bug等问题。\n收集bug/覆盖率： 验证的目标就是提前发现设计中存在的bug，因此需要对发现的bug进行收集和管理。每发现一个新缺陷，需要给定唯一标号，并同设计工程师进行bug定级，然后进行状态追踪。能发现bug最好，但在实际验证中不是每次测试都能发现bug，因此需要另外一个指标评价验证是否到位。该指标通常采用覆盖率，当覆盖率超过一点阈值（例如代码覆盖率大于90%）后方可任务进行了充分验证。\n回归测试： 验证和设计是一个相互迭代的过程，因此当验证出bug后，需要设计进行修正，且需要保证修正后的DUT仍然能正常工作。这种测试的目的是捕获可能由于修改而引入的新错误，或者重新激活旧错误。回归测试可以是全面的，也就是说，它涵盖了所有的功能，或者可以是选择性的，只针对某些特定的功能或系统部分。\n测试报告： 测试报告是对整个验证过程的总结，它提供了关于测试活动的全面视图，包括测试的目标、执行的测试用例、发现的问题和缺陷、测试覆盖率和测试效率等。\n芯片验证层次 按照验证对象的大小，芯片验证通常包含UT、BT、IT、ST四个层次。\n单元测试（Unit Testing， UT）： 这是最低的验证层次，主要针对单个模块或组件进行。目标是验证每个模块或组件的功能是否正确。\n块测试（Block Testing，BT）： 很多时候，单个模块和其他模块存在紧耦合，如果进行单独UT测试，可能存在信号处理复杂，功能验证不准确等问题，这时候可以把多个有耦合关系的模块合并成一个DUT块进行测试。\n集成测试（Integration Testing）： 在单元测试的基础上，将多个模块或组件组合在一起，验证它们能否正确地协同工作，通常用于测试子系统功能是否正常。\n系统测试（System Testing）： ST通常也称为Top验证，在集成测试的基础上，将所有的模块或组件组合在一起，形成一个完整的系统，验证系统的功能是否正确，以及系统的性能是否满足要求。\n理论上，这些层次的验证通常按照从低到高的顺序进行，每个层次的验证都建立在前一个层次的验证的基础上。但实际验证活动中，需要根据企业验证人员的规模、熟练度，功能需求等进行选择，不一定所有层次的验证都需要涉及。在每个层次，都需要编写相应的测试用例，运行测试，收集和分析结果，以确保芯片设计的正确性和质量。\n芯片验证指标 芯片验证的指标，通常包含功能正确性、测试覆盖率、缺陷密度、验证效率、验证成本等多个方面。功能正确性是最基本的验证指标，即芯片是否能够正确地执行其设计的功能。这通常通过运行一系列的功能测试用例来验证，包括正常情况下的功能测试，以及异常情况下的鲁棒性测试。测试覆盖率是指测试用例覆盖了多少设计的功能点，以及覆盖的程度如何。高的测试覆盖率通常意味着更高的验证质量。测试覆盖率可以进一步细分为代码覆盖率、功能覆盖率、条件覆盖率等。缺陷密度是指在一定的设计规模或代码量中，发现的缺陷的数量。低的缺陷密度通常意味着更高的设计质量。验证效率是指在一定的时间和资源下，能够完成的验证工作量。高的验证效率通常意味着更高的验证生产力。验证成本是指进行验证所需要的总体资源，包括人力、设备、时间等。低的验证成本通常意味着更高的验证经济性。\n功能正确性是验证的绝对指标，但在实践中，很多时候无法确定测试方案是否完备，所有测试空间是否全部测试到位，因此需要一个可量化的指标来指导验证是否足够充分，是否可以结束验证。该指标通常采用“测试覆盖率”。测试覆盖率通常有代码覆盖率（行，函数，分支）、功能覆盖率。\n代码行覆盖率： 即在测试过程中，DUT的设计代码中有多少行被执行；\n函数覆盖率： 即在测试过程中，DUT的设计代码中有多少函数被执行；\n分支覆盖率： 即在测试过程中，DUT的设计代码中有多少分支被执行（if else）；\n功能覆盖率： 即在测试过程中，有多少预定义功能被触发。\n高的代码覆盖率可以提高验证的质量和可靠性，但并不能保证验证的完全正确性，因为它不能覆盖所有的输入和状态组合。因此，除了追求高的代码覆盖率，还需要结合其他测试方法和指标，如功能测试、性能测试、缺陷密度等。\n芯片验证管理 芯片验证管理是一个涵盖了芯片验证过程中所有活动的管理过程，包括之前提到的验证策略的制定、验证环境的搭建、测试用例的编写和执行、结果的收集和分析、以及问题和缺陷的跟踪和修复等。芯片验证管理的目标是确保芯片设计满足所有的功能和性能要求，以及规格和标准。\n在芯片验证管理中，首先需要制定一个详细的验证策略，包括验证的目标、范围、方法、时间表等。然后，需要搭建一个适合的验证环境，包括硬件设备、软件工具、测试数据等。接下来，需要编写一系列的测试用例，覆盖所有的功能和性能点，然后执行这些测试用例，收集和分析结果，找出问题和缺陷。最后，需要跟踪和修复这些问题和缺陷，直到所有的测试用例都能通过。\n芯片验证管理是一个复杂的过程，需要多种技能和知识，包括芯片设计、测试方法、项目管理等。它需要与芯片设计、生产、销售等其他活动紧密协作，以确保芯片的质量和性能。芯片验证管理的效果直接影响到芯片的成功和公司的竞争力。因此，芯片验证管理是芯片开发过程中的一个重要环节。\n芯片验证管理过程可以基于“项目管理平台”和“bug管理平台”进行，基于平台的管理效率通常情况下明显高于基于人工的管理模式。\n芯片验证现状 当前，芯片验证通常是在芯片设计公司内部完成的，这一过程不仅技术上复杂，而且具有巨大的成本。从验收与设计的紧密关系来看，芯片验证不可避免地涉及芯片设计的源代码。然而，芯片设计公司通常将芯片设计源代码视为商业机密，这使得必须由公司内部人员来执行芯片验证，难以将验证工作外包。\n芯片验证的重要性在于确保设计的芯片在各种条件下能够可靠运行。验证工作不仅仅是为了满足技术规格，还需要应对不断增长的复杂性和新兴技术的要求。随着半导体行业的发展，芯片验证的工作量不断增加，尤其是对于复杂的芯片而言，验证工作已经超过了设计工作，占比超过70%。这使得在工程师人员配比上，验证工程师人数通常是设计工程师人数的2倍或以上（例如zeku的三千人规模团队中，大约有一千人的设计工程师，两千人的验证工程师。其他大型芯片设计公司的验证人员占比类似或更高）。\n由于验证工作的特殊性，需要对芯片设计源代码进行访问，这在很大程度上限制了芯片验证的外包可能性。芯片设计源代码被视为公司的核心商业机密，涉及到技术细节和创新，因此在安全和法律层面上不太可能与外部方共享。这也导致了公司内部人员必须承担验证工作的重任，增加了公司内部的工作负担和成本。\n在当前情况下，芯片验证工程师的需求持续增加。他们需要具备深厚的技术背景，熟悉各种验证工具和方法，并且对新兴技术有敏锐的洞察力。由于验证工作的复杂性，验证团队通常需要庞大的规模，这与设计团队规模形成鲜明对比。\n为了应对这一挑战，行业可能需要不断探索创新的验证方法和工具，以提高验证效率，降低成本。\n小结：复杂芯片验证成本昂贵，表现在如下几个方面 验证工作量大： 对于复杂芯片，验证工作在整个芯片设计工作中，占比超过 70%。\n人力成本高： 验证工程师人数是设计工程师人数的2倍，对于复杂业务，工程师数量在千人以上。\n内部验证： 芯片设计公司为了保证商业秘密（芯片设计代码）不被泄露，只能选择招聘大量验证工程师，在公司内部进行验证工作。\n芯片验证众包 相比与硬件，软件领域为了减少软件测试成本，测试外包（分包）已经成为常态，该领域的分包业务非常成熟，市场规模已经是千亿人民币级别，并朝万亿级别规模进发。从工作内容上看，软件测试和硬件验证，有非常大的共同特征（系统的目的不同的对象），如果以软件的方式对硬件验证进行分包是否可行？\n把芯片验证工作进行外包（分包）面临诸多挑战，例如： 从业人员基数少： 相比软件领域，硬件开发者数量少了几个数量级。例如在github的统计上（https://madnight.github.io/githut/#/pull_requests/2023/2），传统软件编程语言占（Python、Java、C++，Go）比接近 50%， 而硬件描述语言，verilog占比仅 0.076%，这能从侧面反应出各自领域的开发者数量。\n验证工具商业化： 企业中使用的验证工具（仿真器、形式化、数据分析）几乎都是商业工具，这类工具对于普通人来说几乎不可见，自学难度高。\n开放学习资料少： 芯片验证涉及到访问芯片设计的源代码，而这些源代码通常被视为公司的商业机密和专有技术。芯片设计公司可能不愿意公开详细的验证过程和技术，限制了学习材料的可用性。\n可行性分析 虽然芯片验证领域一直以来相对封闭，但从技术角度而言，采用分包的方式进行验证是一种可行的选择。这主要得益于以下几个因素：\n首先，随着开源芯片项目的逐渐增多，验证过程中所涉及的源代码已经变得更加开放和透明。这些开源项目在设计和验证过程中没有商业机密的顾虑，为学习和研究提供了更多的可能性。即使某些项目涉及商业机密，也可以通过采用加密等方式来隐藏设计代码，从而在一定程度上解决了商业机密的问题，使验证更容易实现。\n其次，芯片验证领域已经涌现出大量的基础验证工具，如verilator和systemc等。这些工具为验证工程师提供了强大的支持，帮助他们更高效地进行验证工作。通过这些工具，验证过程的复杂性和难度得到了一定程度的缓解，为采用分包的验证方法提供了更为可行的技术基础。\n在开源软件领域，已经有一些成功的案例可供参考。例如，Linux内核的验证过程采用了分包的方式，不同的开发者和团队分别负责不同的模块验证，最终形成一个整体完备的系统。类似地，机器学习领域的ImageNet项目也采用了分包标注的策略，通过众包的方式完成大规模的图像标注任务。这些案例为芯片验证领域提供了成功的经验，证明了分包验证在提高效率、降低成本方面的潜力。\n因此，尽管芯片验证领域相对于其他技术领域而言仍显得封闭，但技术的进步和开源项目的增多为采用分包验证提供了新的可能性。通过借鉴其他领域的成功经验和利用现有的验证工具，我们有望在芯片验证中推动更加开放、高效的验证方法的应用，进一步促进行业的发展。这种技术的开放性和灵活性将为验证工程师提供更多的选择，推动芯片验证领域迎来更为创新和多样化的发展。\n技术路线 为了克服挑战，让更多的人参与到芯片验证，本项目从如下几个技术方向进行持续尝试\n提供多语言验证工具： 传统芯片验证是基于System Verilog编程语言进行，但是该语言用户基数少，为了让其他软件开发/测试的技术人员参与到芯片验证，本项目提供多语言验证转换工具Picker，它可以让验证者使用自己熟悉的编程语言（例如C++/Python/Java/Go）基于开源验证工具参与验证工作。\n提供验证学习材料： 芯片验证学习材料少，主要原因由于商业公司几乎不可能公开其内部资料，为此本项目会持续更新学习材料，让验证人员可在线，免费学习所需要的技能。\n提供真实芯片验证案例： 为了让学习材料更具使用性，本项目以“香山昆明湖（工业级高性能risc-v处理器）IP核”作为基础，从中摘取模块持续更新验证案例。\n组织芯片设计分包验证： 学以致用是每个人学习的期望目标，为此本项目定期组织芯片设计的验证分包，让所有人（无论你是大学生、验证专家、软件开发测试者、还是中学生）都可以参与到真实芯片的设计工作中去。\n本项目的目标是达到如下愿景，“打开传统验证模式的黑盒，让所有感兴趣的人可以随时随地的，用自己擅长的编程语言参与芯片验证”。\n","categories":"","description":"关于芯片验证的基本概念\n","excerpt":"关于芯片验证的基本概念\n","ref":"/mlvp/docs/basic/ic_verify/","tags":"","title":"芯片验证"},{"body":"生成库文件

This page introduces the basics of digital circuits. Digital circuits use digital signals and are the foundation of most modern computers.\nWhat Are Digital Circuits Digital circuits are electronic circuits that use two discrete voltage levels to represent information. Typically, digital circuits use two power supply voltages to indicate high (H) and low (L) levels, representing the digits 1 and 0 respectively. This representation uses binary signals to transmit and process information.\nMost digital circuits are built using field-effect transistors, with MOSFETs (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors) being the most common. MOSFETs are semiconductor devices that control current flow using an electric field, enabling digital signal processing.\nIn digital circuits, MOSFETs are combined to form various logic gates like AND, OR, and NOT gates. These logic gates are combined in different ways to create the various functions and operations in digital circuits. Here are some key features of digital circuits:\n(1) Voltage Representation： Digital circuits use two voltage levels, high and low, to represent digital information. Typically, a high level represents the digit 1, and a low level represents the digit 0.\n(2) MOSFET Implementation： MOSFETs are one of the most commonly used components in digital circuits. By controlling the on and off states of MOSFETs, digital signal processing and logic operations can be achieved.\n(3) Logic Gate Combinations： Logic gates, composed of MOSFETs, are the basic building blocks of digital circuits. By combining different logic gates, complex digital circuits can be built to perform various logical functions.\n(4) Binary Representation： Information in digital circuits is typically represented using the binary system. Each digit can be made up of a series of binary bits, which can be processed and operated on within digital circuits.\n(5) Signal Processing： Digital circuits convert and process signals through changes in voltage and logic operations. This discrete processing method makes digital circuits well-suited for computing and information processing tasks.\nWhy Learn Digital Circuits Learning digital circuits is fundamental and necessary for the chip verification process, primarily for the following reasons:\n(1) Understanding Design Principles： Digital circuits are the foundation of chip design. Knowing the basic principles and design methods of digital circuits is crucial for understanding the structure and function of chips. The goal of chip verification is to ensure that the designed digital circuits work according to specifications in actual hardware, and understanding digital circuits is key to comprehending the design.\n(2) Design Standards： Chip verification typically involves checking whether the design meets specific standards and functional requirements. Learning digital circuits helps in understanding these standards, thus building better test cases and verification processes to ensure thorough and accurate verification.\n(3) Timing and Clocks： Timing issues are common challenges in digital circuit design and verification. Learning digital circuits helps in understanding concepts of timing and clocks, ensuring that timing issues are correctly handled during verification, avoiding timing delays and conflicts in the circuit.\n(4) Logical Analysis： Chip verification often involves logical analysis to ensure circuit correctness. Learning digital circuits fosters a deep understanding of logic, aiding in logical analysis and troubleshooting.\n(5) Writing Test Cases： In chip verification, various test cases need to be written to ensure design correctness. Understanding digital circuits helps in designing comprehensive and targeted test cases, covering all aspects of the circuit.\n(6) Signal Integrity： Learning digital circuits helps in understanding signal propagation and integrity issues within circuits. Ensuring proper signal transmission under different conditions is crucial, especially in high-speed designs.\nOverall, learning digital circuits provides foundational knowledge and tools for chip verification, enabling verification engineers to better understand designs, write effective test cases, analyze verification results, and troubleshoot issues. Theoretical and practical experience with digital circuits is indispensable for chip verification engineers.\nDigital Circuits Basics You can learn digital circuits through the following online resources：\nTsinghua University’s Digital Circuits Basics USTC Digital Circuit Lab Digital Design and Computer Architecture MIT Analysis and Design of Digital Integrated Circuits Hardware Description Language Chisel Traditional Description Languages Hardware Description Languages (HDL) are languages used to describe digital circuits, systems, and hardware. They allow engineers to describe hardware structure, function, and behavior through text files, enabling abstraction and modeling of hardware designs.\nHDL is commonly used for designing and simulating digital circuits such as processors, memory, controllers, etc. It provides a formal method to describe the behavior and structure of hardware circuits, making it easier for design engineers to perform hardware design, verification, and simulation.\nCommon hardware description languages include:\nVerilog：One of the most used HDLs, Verilog is an event-driven language widely used for digital circuit design, verification, and simulation. VHDL：Another common HDL, VHDL is an object-oriented language offering richer abstraction and modular design methods. SystemVerilog：An extension of Verilog, SystemVerilog introduces advanced features like object-oriented programming and randomized testing, making Verilog more suitable for complex system design and verification. Chisel Chisel is a modern, advanced hardware description language that differs from traditional Verilog and VHDL. It’s a hardware construction language based on Scala. Chisel offers a more modern and flexible way to describe hardware, leveraging Scala’s features to easily implement parameterization, abstraction, and reuse while maintaining hardware-level efficiency and performance.\nChisel’s features include:\nModern Syntax: Chisel’s syntax is more similar to software programming languages like Scala, making hardware description more intuitive and concise. Parameterization and Abstraction: Chisel supports parameterization and abstraction, allowing for the creation of configurable and reusable hardware modules. Type Safety: Based on Scala, Chisel has type safety features, enabling many errors to be detected at compile-time. Generating Performance-Optimized Hardware: Chisel code can be converted to Verilog and then synthesized, placed, routed, and simulated by standard EDA toolchains to generate performance-optimized hardware. Strong Simulation Support: Chisel provides simulation support integrated with ScalaTest and Firrtl, making hardware simulation and verification more convenient and flexible. Chisel Example of a Full Adder The circuit design is shown below:\nComplete Chisel code:\npackage examples import chisel3._ class FullAdder extends Module { // Define IO ports val io = IO(new Bundle { val a = Input(UInt(1.W)) // Input port 'a' of width 1 bit val b = Input(UInt(1.W)) // Input port 'b' of width 1 bit val cin = Input(UInt(1.W)) // Input port 'cin' (carry-in) of width 1 bit val sum = Output(UInt(1.W)) // Output port 'sum' of width 1 bit val cout = Output(UInt(1.W))// Output port 'cout' (carry-out) of width 1 bit }) // Calculate sum bit (sum of a, b, and cin) val s1 = io.a ^ io.b // XOR operation between 'a' and 'b' io.sum := s1 ^ io.cin // XOR operation between 's1' and 'cin', result assigned to 'sum' // Calculate carry-out bit val s3 = io.a \u0026 io.b // AND operation between 'a' and 'b', result assigned to 's3' val s2 = s1 \u0026 io.cin // AND operation between 's1' and 'cin', result assigned to 's2' io.cout := s2 | s3 // OR operation between 's2' and 's3', result assigned to 'cout' } You can refer to Chisel learning materials from the official documentation: https://www.chisel-lang.org/docs\n","categories":"","description":"Basic concepts of digital circuits\n","excerpt":"Basic concepts of digital circuits\n","ref":"/mlvp/en/docs/basic/ic_base/","tags":"","title":"Digital Circuits"},{"body":" This page will briefly introduce what verification is and concepts used in the examples, such as DUT (Design Under Test) and RM (Reference Model).\n","categories":["Sample Projects","Tutorials"],"description":"Detailed usage instructions for the Open Verification Platform environment.","excerpt":"Detailed usage instructions for the Open Verification Platform …","ref":"/mlvp/en/docs/env_usage/","tags":["examples","docs"],"title":"Environment Usage"},{"body":"","categories":["Example Projects","Tutorials"],"description":"Using TileLink Protocol for L2 Cache Driven by C++","excerpt":"Using TileLink Protocol for L2 Cache Driven by C++","ref":"/mlvp/en/docs/advance_case/tilelink/","tags":["examples","docs"],"title":"TileLink Protocol"},{"body":"","categories":["示例项目","教程"],"description":"基于C++驱动使用 TillLink 协议的 L2 Cache","excerpt":"基于C++驱动使用 TillLink 协议的 L2 Cache","ref":"/mlvp/docs/advance_case/tilelink/","tags":["examples","docs"],"title":"TileLink 协议"},{"body":" Introduction to chip verification using the Guoke Cache as an example, covering the basic verification process and report writing.\n","categories":["Sample Projects","Tutorials"],"description":"Introduction to the basic knowledge required for working with the open verification platform.","excerpt":"Introduction to the basic knowledge required for working with the open …","ref":"/mlvp/en/docs/basic/","tags":["examples","docs"],"title":"Verification Basics"},{"body":"Usage When using the Picker tool to encapsulate the DUT, use the -w [wave_file] option to specify the waveform file to be saved. Different waveform file types are supported for different backend simulators, as follows:\nVerilator .vcd format waveform file. .fst format waveform file, a more efficient compressed file. VCS .fsdb format waveform file, a more efficient compressed file. Note that if you choose to generate the libDPI_____.so file yourself, the waveform file format is not restricted by the above constraints. The waveform file format is determined when the simulator constructs libDPI.so, so if you generate it yourself, you need to specify the waveform file format using the corresponding simulator’s configuration.\nPython Example Normally, the DUT needs to be explicitly declared complete to notify the simulator to perform post-processing tasks (writing waveform, coverage files, etc.). In Python, after completing all tests, call the .finalize() method of the DUT to notify the simulator that the task is complete, and then flush the files to disk.\nUsing the Adder Example, the test program is as follows:\nfrom UT_Adder import * if __name__ == \"__main__\": dut = DUTAdder() for i in range(10): dut.a.value = i * 2 dut.b.value = int(i / 4) dut.Step(1) print(dut.sum.value, dut.cout.value) dut.finalize() #

The DUT is the primary subject of verification. When creating a DUT based on the picker tool, it is essential to consider the functionality, performance requirements, and verification goals of the subject under test. These goals may include the need for faster execution speed or more detailed test information. Generally, the DUT, written in RTL, is combined with its surrounding environment to form the verification environment (test_env), where test cases are written. In this project, the DUT is the Python module that needs to be tested and converted through RTL. Traditional RTL languages include Verilog, System Verilog, VHDL, etc. However, as an emerging RTL design language, （https://www.chisel-lang.org/） is playing an increasingly important role in RTL design due to its object-oriented features and ease of use. This chapter introduces how to create a DUT using the conversion of the cache source code from the Guoke Processor-NutShell to a Python module as an example.\nChisel and Guoke Chisel is a high-level hardware construction language (HCL) based on the Scala language. Traditional HDLs describe circuits, while HCLs generate circuits, making them more abstract and advanced. The Stage package provided in Chisel can convert HCL designs into traditional HDL languages such as Verilog and System Verilog. With tools like Mill and Sbt, automation in development can be achieved.\nGuoke is a sequential single-issue processor implementation based on the RISC-V RV64 open instruction set, modularly designed using the Chisel language. For a more detailed introduction to Guoke, please refer to the link: https://oscpu.github.io/NutShell-doc/.\nGuoke cache The Guoke Cache (Nutshell Cache) is the cache module used in the Guoke processor. It features a three-stage pipeline design. When the third stage pipeline detects that the current request is MMIO or a refill occurs, it will block the pipeline. The Guoke Cache also uses a customizable modular design that can generate different-sized L1 Caches or L2 Caches by changing parameters. Additionally, the Guoke Cache has a coherence interface to handle coherence-related requests.\nChisel to Verilog The stage library in Chisel helps generate traditional HDL code such as Verilog and System Verilog from Chisel code. Below is a brief introduction on how to convert a cache implementation based on Chisel into the corresponding Verilog circuit description.\nInitializing the Guoke Environment First, download the entire Guoke source code from the source repository and initialize it:\nmkdir cache-ut cd cache-ut git clone https://github.com/OSCPU/NutShell.git cd NutShell \u0026\u0026 git checkout 97a025d make init Creating Scala Compilation Configuration Then, create build.sc in the cache-ut directory with the following content:\nimport $file.NutShell.build import mill._, scalalib._ import coursier.maven.MavenRepository import mill.scalalib.TestModule._ // Specify Nutshell dependencies object difftest extends NutShell.build.CommonNS { override def millSourcePath = os.pwd / \"NutShell\" / \"difftest\" } // Nutshell configuration object NtShell extends NutShell.build.CommonNS with NutShell.build.HasChiselTests { override def millSourcePath = os.pwd / \"NutShell\" override def moduleDeps = super.moduleDeps ++ Seq( difftest, ) } // UT environment configuration object ut extends NutShell.build.CommonNS with ScalaTest{ override def millSourcePath = os.pwd override def moduleDeps = super.moduleDeps ++ Seq( NtShell ) } Instantiating cache After creating the configuration information, create the src/main/scala source code directory according to the Scala specification. Then, in the source code directory, create nut_cache.scala and use the following code to instantiate the Cache and convert it into Verilog code:\npackage ut_nutshell import chisel3._ import chisel3.util._ import nutcore._ import top._ import chisel3.stage._ object CacheMain extends App { (new ChiselStage).execute(args, Seq( ChiselGeneratorAnnotation(() =\u003e new Cache()(CacheConfig(ro = false, name = \"tcache\", userBits = 16))) )) } Generating RTL After creating all the files (build.sc, src/main/scala/nut_cache.scala), execute the following command in the cache-ut directory:\nmkdir build mill --no-server -d ut.runMain ut_nutshell.CacheMain --target-dir build --output-file Cache Note: For the Mill environment configuration, please refer to https://mill-build.com/mill/Intro_to_Mill.html.\nAfter successfully executing the above command, a Verilog file Cache.v will be generated in the build directory. Then, the picker tool can be used to convert Cache.v into a Python module. Besides Chisel, almost all other HCL languages can generate corresponding RTL codes, so the basic process above also applies to other HCLs.\nDUT Compilation Generally, if you need the DUT to generate waveforms, coverage, etc., it will slow down the DUT’s execution speed. Therefore, when generating a Python module through the picker tool, it will be generated according to various configurations: (1) Turn off all debug information; (2) Enable waveforms; (3) Enable code line coverage. The first configuration aims to quickly build the environment for regression testing, etc.; the second is used to analyze specific errors, timing, etc.; the third is used to improve coverage.\n","categories":["Sample Projects","Learning Materials"],"description":"Using Guoke Cache as an example, this document introduces how to create a DUT based on Chisel.","excerpt":"Using Guoke Cache as an example, this document introduces how to …","ref":"/mlvp/en/docs/basic/create_dut/","tags":["examples","docs"],"title":"Creating DUT"},{"body":"Multi-File Input and Output In many cases, a module in one file may instantiate modules in other files. In such cases, you can use the picker tool’s -f option to process multiple Verilog source files. For example, suppose you have three source files: Cache.sv, CacheStage.sv, and CacheMeta.sv:\nFile List Cache.sv // In module Cache( ... ); CacheStage s1( ... ); CacheStage s2( ... ); CacheStage s3( ... ); CacheMeta cachemeta( ... ); endmodule CacheStage.sv // In CacheStage.sv module CacheStage( ... ); ... endmodule CacheMeta.sv // In CacheMeta.sv module CacheMeta( ... ); ... endmodule Usage In this case, the module under test is Cache, which is in Cache.sv. You can generate the DUT using the following command:\nCommand Line Specification picker export Cache.sv --fs CacheStage.sv,CacheMeta.sv --sname Cache Specification through a File List File You can also use a .txt file to specify multiple input files:\npicker export Cache.sv --fs src.txt --sname Cache Where the contents of src.txt are:\nCacheStage.sv CacheMeta.sv Notes It is important to note that even when using multiple file inputs, you still need to specify the file containing the top-level module under test, as shown in the example above with Cache.sv. When using multiple file inputs, Picker will pass all files to the simulator, which will compile them simultaneously. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that the module names in all files are unique.

Use the genhtml command of the lcov tool based on coverage.info and RTL code source files to generate a complete code coverage report. The process is as follows:\nEnable the COVERAGE feature when generating the DUT with Picker (add the -c option). After the simulator runs, a coverage database file V{DUT_NAME}.dat will be generated after dut.finalize() is called. Use the write-info function of verilator_coverage to convert it to a .info file. Use the genhtml function of lcov to generate an HTML report using the .info file and the RTL source files specified in the file. Note: The RTL source files specified in the file refer to the source file paths used when generating the DUT, and these paths need to be valid in the current environment. In simple terms, all .sv/.v files used for compilation need to exist in the current environment, and the directory remains unchanged.\nverilator_coverage The verilator_coverage tool is used to process coverage data generated by the DUT after running .dat files. The tool can process and merge multiple .dat files and has two main functions:\nGenerate a .info file based on the .dat file for subsequent generation of a web page report.\n-annotate \u003coutput_dir\u003e：Present the coverage situation in the source file in annotated form, and save the result to output_dir. The format is as follows:\n100000 input logic a; // Begins with whitespace, because // number of hits (100000) is above the limit. %000000 input logic b; // Begins with %, because // number of hits (0) is below the limit. -annotate-min \u003ccount\u003e：Specify the limit as count for the above.\nCombine the .dat file with the source code file, and write the coverage data in annotated form into the specified directory.\n-write \u003cmerged-datafile\u003e -read \u003cdatafiles\u003e：Merge several .dat (datafiles) files into one .dat file. -write-info \u003cmerged-info\u003e -read \u003cdatafiles\u003e：Merge several .dat (datafiles) files into one .info file. genhtml The genhtml provided by the lcov package can export a more readable HTML report from the .info file. The command format is: genhtml [OPTIONS] \u003cinfofiles\u003e. It is recommended to use the -o \u003coutputdir\u003e option to output the results to a specified directory.\nFor example, in theAddr project. Usage Example If you enable the -c option when using Picker, after the simulation ends, a V{DUT_NAME}.dat file will be generated.

Compared to a traditional single-port stack, a dual-port stack allows simultaneous read and write operations. In scenarios such as multithreaded concurrent read and write operations, the dual-port stack can provide better performance. In this example, we provide a simple dual-port stack implementation, with the source code as follows:\nmodule dual_port_stack ( input clk, input rst, // Interface 0 input in0_valid, output in0_ready, input [7:0] in0_data, input [1:0] in0_cmd, output out0_valid, input out0_ready, output [7:0] out0_data, output [1:0] out0_cmd, // Interface 1 input in1_valid, output in1_ready, input [7:0] in1_data, input [1:0] in1_cmd, output out1_valid, input out1_ready, output [7:0] out1_data, output [1:0] out1_cmd ); // Command definitions localparam CMD_PUSH = 2'b00; localparam CMD_POP = 2'b01; localparam CMD_PUSH_OKAY = 2'b10; localparam CMD_POP_OKAY = 2'b11; // Stack memory and pointer reg [7:0] stack_mem[0:255]; reg [7:0] sp; reg busy; reg [7:0] out0_data_reg, out1_data_reg; reg [1:0] out0_cmd_reg, out1_cmd_reg; reg out0_valid_reg, out1_valid_reg; assign out0_data = out0_data_reg; assign out0_cmd = out0_cmd_reg; assign out0_valid = out0_valid_reg; assign out1_data = out1_data_reg; assign out1_cmd = out1_cmd_reg; assign out1_valid = out1_valid_reg; always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin if (rst) begin sp \u003c= 0; busy \u003c= 0; end else begin // Interface 0 Request Handling if (!busy \u0026\u0026 in0_valid \u0026\u0026 in0_ready) begin case (in0_cmd) CMD_PUSH: begin busy \u003c= 1; sp \u003c= sp + 1; out0_valid_reg \u003c= 1; stack_mem[sp] \u003c= in0_data; out0_cmd_reg \u003c= CMD_PUSH_OKAY; end CMD_POP: begin busy \u003c= 1; sp \u003c= sp - 1; out0_valid_reg \u003c= 1; out0_data_reg \u003c= stack_mem[sp - 1]; out0_cmd_reg \u003c= CMD_POP_OKAY; end default: begin out0_valid_reg \u003c= 0; end endcase end // Interface 1 Request Handling if (!busy \u0026\u0026 in1_valid \u0026\u0026 in1_ready) begin case (in1_cmd) CMD_PUSH: begin busy \u003c= 1; sp \u003c= sp + 1; out1_valid_reg \u003c= 1; stack_mem[sp] \u003c= in1_data; out1_cmd_reg \u003c= CMD_PUSH_OKAY; end CMD_POP: begin busy \u003c= 1; sp \u003c= sp - 1; out1_valid_reg \u003c= 1; out1_data_reg \u003c= stack_mem[sp - 1]; out1_cmd_reg \u003c= CMD_POP_OKAY; end default: begin out1_valid_reg \u003c= 0; end endcase end // Interface 0 Response Handling if (busy \u0026\u0026 out0_ready) begin out0_valid_reg \u003c= 0; busy \u003c= 0; end // Interface 1 Response Handling if (busy \u0026\u0026 out1_ready) begin out1_valid_reg \u003c= 0; busy \u003c= 0; end end end assign in0_ready = (in0_cmd == CMD_PUSH \u0026\u0026 sp \u003c 255 || in0_cmd == CMD_POP \u0026\u0026 sp \u003e 0) \u0026\u0026 !busy; assign in1_ready = (in1_cmd == CMD_PUSH \u0026\u0026 sp \u003c 255 || in1_cmd == CMD_POP \u0026\u0026 sp \u003e 0) \u0026\u0026 !busy \u0026\u0026 !(in0_ready \u0026\u0026 in0_valid); endmodule In this implementation, aside from the clock signal (clk) and reset signal (rst), there are also input and output signals for the two ports, which have the same interface definition. The meaning of each signal for the ports is as follows:\nRequest Port (in)\nin_valid: Input data valid signal\nin_ready: Input data ready signal\nin_data: Input data\nin_cmd: Input command (0: PUSH, 1: POP)\nResponse Port (out)\nout_valid: Output data valid signal\nout_ready: Output data ready signal\nout_data: Output data\nout_cmd: Output command (2: PUSH_OKAY, 3: POP_OKAY)\nWhen we want to perform an operation on the stack through a port, we first need to write the required data and command to the input port, and then wait for the output port to return the result. Specifically, if we want to perform a PUSH operation on the stack, we should first write the data to be pushed into in_data, then set in_cmd to 0, indicating a PUSH operation, and set in_valid to 1, indicating that the input data is valid. Next, we need to wait for in_ready to be 1, ensuring that the data has been correctly received, at which point the PUSH request has been correctly sent.After the command is successfully sent, we need to wait for the stack’s response information on the response port. When out_valid is 1, it indicates that the stack has completed the corresponding operation. At this point, we can read the stack’s returned data from out_data (the returned data of the POP operation will be placed here) and read the stack’s returned command from out_cmd. After reading the data, we need to set out_ready to 1 to notify the stack that the returned information has been correctly received. If requests from both ports are valid simultaneously, the stack will prioritize processing requests from port 0.\nSetting Up the Driver Environment Similar to Case Study 1 and Case Study 2, before testing the dual-port stack, we first need to use the Picker tool to build the RTL code into a Python Module. After the build is complete, we will use a Python script to drive the RTL code for testing. First, create a file named dual_port_stack.v and copy the above RTL code into this file. Then, execute the following command in the same folder:\npicker export --autobuild=true dual_port_stack.v -w dual_port_stack.fst --sname dual_port_stack --tdir picker_out_dual_port_stack --lang python -e --sim verilator The generated driver environment is located in the picker_out_dual_port_stack folder. Inside, UT_dual_port_stack is the generated Python Module, and example.py is the test script. You can run the test script with the following commands:\ncd picker_out_dual_port_stack python3 example.py If no errors occur during the run, it means the environment has been set up correctly.\nDriving the DUT with Coroutines Driving the DUT with Callback Functions In this case, we need to drive a dual-port stack to test its functionality. However, you may quickly realize that the methods used in Cases 1 and 2 are insufficient for driving a dual-port stack. In the previous tests, the DUT had a single execution logic where you input data into the DUT and wait for the output.\nHowever, a dual-port stack is different because its two ports operate with independent execution logic. During the drive process, these two ports might be in entirely different states. For example, while port 0 is waiting for data from the DUT, port 1 might be sending a new request. In such situations, simple sequential execution logic will struggle to drive the DUT effectively.\nTherefore, in this case, we will use the dual-port stack as an example to introduce a callback function-based driving method to handle such DUTs.\nIntroduction to Callback Functions A callback function is a common programming technique that allows us to pass a function as an argument, which is then called when a certain condition is met. In the generated Python Module, we provide an interface StepRis for registering callback functions with the internal execution environment. Here’s how it works:\nfrom UT_dual_port_stack import DUTdual_port_stack def callback(cycles): print(f\"The current clock cycle is {cycles}\") dut = DUTdual_port_stack() dut.StepRis(callback) dut.Step(10) You can run this code directly to see the effect of the callback function. In the above code, we define a callback function callback that takes a cycles parameter and prints the current clock cycle each time it is called. We then register this callback function to the DUT via StepRis.Once the callback function is registered, each time the Step function is run, which corresponds to each clock cycle, the callback function is invoked on the rising edge of the clock signal, with the current clock cycle passed as an argument. Using this approach, we can write different execution logics as callback functions and register multiple callback functions to the DUT, thereby achieving parallel driving of the DUT.\nDual-Port Stack Driven by Callback Functions To complete a full execution logic using callback functions, we typically write it in the form of a state machine. Each callback function invocation triggers a state change within the state machine, and multiple invocations complete a full execution logic.\nBelow is an example code for driving a dual-port stack using callback functions:\nimport random from UT_dual_port_stack import * from enum import Enum class StackModel: def __init__(self): self.stack = [] def commit_push(self, data): self.stack.append(data) print(\"push\", data) def commit_pop(self, dut_data): print(\"Pop\", dut_data) model_data = self.stack.pop() assert model_data == dut_data, f\"The model data {model_data} is not equal to the dut data {dut_data}\" print(f\"Pass: {model_data} == {dut_data}\") class SinglePortDriver: class Status(Enum): IDLE = 0 WAIT_REQ_READY = 1 WAIT_RESP_VALID = 2 class BusCMD(Enum): PUSH = 0 POP = 1 PUSH_OKAY = 2 POP_OKAY = 3 def __init__(self, dut, model: StackModel, port_dict): self.dut = dut self.model = model self.port_dict = port_dict self.status = self.Status.IDLE self.operation_num = 0 self.remaining_delay = 0 def push(self): self.port_dict[\"in_valid\"].value = 1 self.port_dict[\"in_cmd\"].value = self.BusCMD.PUSH.value self.port_dict[\"in_data\"].value = random.randint(0, 2**32-1) def pop(self): self.port_dict[\"in_valid\"].value = 1 self.port_dict[\"in_cmd\"].value = self.BusCMD.POP.value def step_callback(self, cycle): if self.status == self.Status.WAIT_REQ_READY: if self.port_dict[\"in_ready\"].value == 1: self.port_dict[\"in_valid\"].value = 0 self.port_dict[\"out_ready\"].value = 1 self.status = self.Status.WAIT_RESP_VALID if self.port_dict[\"in_cmd\"].value == self.BusCMD.PUSH.value: self.model.commit_push(self.port_dict[\"in_data\"].value) elif self.status == self.Status.WAIT_RESP_VALID: if self.port_dict[\"out_valid\"].value == 1: self.port_dict[\"out_ready\"].value = 0 self.status = self.Status.IDLE self.remaining_delay = random.randint(0, 5) if self.port_dict[\"out_cmd\"].value == self.BusCMD.POP_OKAY.value: self.model.commit_pop(self.port_dict[\"out_data\"].value) if self.status == self.Status.IDLE: if self.remaining_delay == 0: if self.operation_num \u003c 10: self.push() elif self.operation_num \u003c 20: self.pop() else: return self.operation_num += 1 self.status = self.Status.WAIT_REQ_READY else: self.remaining_delay -= 1 def test_stack(stack): model = StackModel() port0 = SinglePortDriver(stack, model, { \"in_valid\": stack.in0_valid, \"in_ready\": stack.in0_ready, \"in_data\": stack.in0_data, \"in_cmd\": stack.in0_cmd, \"out_valid\": stack.out0_valid, \"out_ready\": stack.out0_ready, \"out_data\": stack.out0_data, \"out_cmd\": stack.out0_cmd, }) port1 = SinglePortDriver(stack, model, { \"in_valid\": stack.in1_valid, \"in_ready\": stack.in1_ready, \"in_data\": stack.in1_data, \"in_cmd\": stack.in1_cmd, \"out_valid\": stack.out1_valid, \"out_ready\": stack.out1_ready, \"out_data\": stack.out1_data, \"out_cmd\": stack.out1_cmd, }) dut.StepRis(port0.step_callback) dut.StepRis(port1.step_callback) dut.Step(200) if __name__ == \"__main__\": dut = DUTdual_port_stack() dut.InitClock(\"clk\") test_stack(dut) dut.Finish() In the code above, the driving process is implemented such that each port independently drives the DUT, with a random delay added after each request is completed. Each port performs 10 PUSH operations and 10 POP operations.When a PUSH or POP request takes effect, the corresponding commit_push or commit_pop function in the StackModel is called to simulate stack behavior. After each POP operation, the data returned by the DUT is compared with the model’s data to ensure consistency.To implement the driving behavior for a single port, we created the SinglePortDriver class, which includes a method for sending and receiving data. The step_callback function handles the internal update logic.In the test_stack function, we create a SinglePortDriver instance for each port of the dual-port stack, pass the corresponding interfaces, and register the callback function to the DUT using the StepRis function. When dut.Step(200) is called, the callback function is automatically invoked each clock cycle to complete the entire driving logic.SinglePortDriver Driving Logic As mentioned earlier, callback functions typically require the execution logic to be implemented as a state machine. Therefore, in the SinglePortDriver class, the status of each port is recorded, including:\nIDLE: Idle state, waiting for the next operation.\nIn the idle state, check the remaining_delay status to determine whether the current delay has ended. If the delay has ended, proceed with the next operation; otherwise, continue waiting.\nWhen the next operation is ready, check the operation_num status (the number of operations already performed) to determine whether the next operation should be PUSH or POP. Then, call the corresponding function to assign values to the port and switch the status to WAIT_REQ_READY.\nWAIT_REQ_READY: Waiting for the request port to be ready.\nAfter the request is sent (in_valid is valid), wait for the in_ready signal to be valid to ensure the request has been correctly received.\nOnce the request is correctly received, set in_valid to 0 and out_ready to 1, indicating the request is complete and ready to receive a response.\nWAIT_RESP_VALID: Waiting for the response port to return data.\nAfter the request is correctly received, wait for the DUT’s response, i.e., wait for the out_valid signal to be valid. When the out_valid signal is valid, it indicates that the response has been generated and the request is complete. Set out_ready to 0 and switch the status to IDLE. Running the Test Copy the above code into example.py, and then run the following command:\ncd picker_out_dual_port_stack python3 example.py You can run the test code for this case directly, and you will see output similar to the following:\n... push 77 push 140 push 249 push 68 push 104 push 222 ... Pop 43 Pass: 43 == 43 Pop 211 Pass: 211 == 211 Pop 16 Pass: 16 == 16 Pop 255 Pass: 255 == 255 Pop 222 Pass: 222 == 222 Pop 104 ... In the output, you can see the data for each PUSH and POP operation, as well as the result of each POP operation. If there is no error message in the output, it indicates that the test has passed.\nPros and Cons of Callback-Driven Design By using callbacks, we can achieve parallel driving of the DUT, as demonstrated in this example. We utilized two callbacks to drive two ports with independent execution logic. In simple scenarios, callbacks offer a straightforward method for parallel driving.\nHowever, as shown in this example, even implementing a simple “request-response” flow requires maintaining a significant amount of internal state. Callbacks break down what should be a cohesive execution logic into multiple function calls, adding considerable complexity to both the code writing and debugging processes.\n","categories":["Example Projects","Tutorials"],"description":"A dual-port stack is a stack with two ports, each supporting push and pop operations.

Determine the verification object and goals Typically, the design documentation of the DUT is also delivered to the verification engineer. At this point, you need to read the documentation or source code to understand the basic functions, main structure, and expected functionalities of the verification object.\n2. Build the basic verification environment After fully understanding the design, you need to build the basic verification environment. For example, in addition to the DUT generated by Picker, you may also need to set up a reference model for comparison and a signal monitoring platform for evaluating subsequent functional points.\n3. Decompose functional points and test points Before officially starting the verification, you need to extract the functional points and further decompose them into test points. You can refer to: CSDN: Chip Verification Series - Decomposition of Testpoints\n4. Construct test cases With the test points, you need to construct test cases to cover the corresponding test points. A test case may cover multiple test points.\n5. Collect test results After running all the test cases, you need to summarize all the test results. Generally, this includes line coverage and functional coverage. The former can be obtained through the coverage function provided by the Picker tool, while the latter requires you to judge whether a function is covered by the test cases through monitoring the behavior of the DUT.\n6. Evaluate the test results Finally, you need to evaluate the obtained results, such as whether there are design errors, whether a function cannot be triggered, whether the design documentation description is consistent with the DUT behavior, and whether the design documentation is clearly described.\nNext, we will introduce the general verification process usingMMIO read and write of Nutshell Cache as an example:\n1 Determine the verification object and goals:：\nThe MMIO read and write function of the Nutshell Cache. MMIO is a special type of IO mapping that supports accessing IO device registers by accessing memory addresses. Since the register state of IO devices can change at any time, it is not suitable to cache it. When receiving an MMIO request, the Nutshell cache will directly access the MMIO memory area to read or write data instead of querying hit/miss in the ordinary cache line.\n2 Build the basic verification environment:：\nWe can roughly divide the verification environment into five parts: 1. Testcase Driver：Responsible for generating corresponding signals driven by test cases 2. Monitor：Monitors signals to determine whether functions are covered and correct 3. Ref Cache：A simple reference model 4. Memory/MMIO Ram：Simulates peripheral devices to simulate corresponding cache requests 5. Nutshell Cache Dut：DUT generated by Picker\nIn addition, you may need to further encapsulate the DUT interface to achieve more convenient read and write request operations. For details, refer to Nutshll cachewrapper.\n3 Decompose functional points and test points：\nNutshell cache can respond to MMIO requests, further decomposing into the following test points:\nTest Point 1：MMIO requests will be forwarded to the MMIO port Test Point 2：The cache will not issue burst transfer requests when responding to MMIO requests Test Point 3：The cache will block the pipeline when responding to MMIO requests\n4 Construct test cases： The construction of test cases is simple. Knowing that the MMIO address range of the Nutshell cache obtained through Creating DUTis 0x30000000~0x7fffffff, we only need to access this memory range to obtain the expected MMIO results. Note that to trigger the test point of blocking the pipeline, you may need to initiate requests continuously.\nHere is a simple test case:\n# import CacheWrapper here def mmio_test(cache: CacheWrapper): mmio_lb\t= 0x30000000 mmio_rb\t= 0x30001000 print(\"\\n[MMIO Test]: Start MMIO Serial Test\") for addr in range(mmio_lb, mmio_rb, 16): addr \u0026= ~(0xf) addr1 = addr addr2 = addr + 4 addr3 = addr + 8 cache.trigger_read_req(addr1) cache.trigger_read_req(addr2) cache.trigger_read_req(addr3) cache.recv() cache.recv() cache.recv() print(\"[MMIO Test]: Finish MMIO Serial Test\") 5 Collect test results：\n''' In tb_cache.py ''' # import packages here class TestCache(): def setup_class(self): color.print_blue(\"\\nCache Test Start\") self.dut = DUTCache(\"libDPICache.so\") self.dut.init_clock(\"clock\") # Init here # ... self.testlist = [\"mmio_serial\"] def teardown_class(self): self.dut.finalize() color.print_blue(\"\\nCache Test End\") def __reset(self): # Reset cache and devices # MMIO Test def test_mmio(self): if (\"mmio_serial\" in self.testlist): # Run test from ..test.test_mmio import mmio_test mmio_test(self.cache, self.ref_cache) else: print(\"\\nmmio test is not included\") def run(self): self.setup_class() # test self.test_mmio() self.teardown_class() pass if __name__ == \"__main__\": tb = TestCache() tb.run() Run：\npython3 tb_cache.py The above is only a rough execution process, for details refer to：Nutshell Cache Verify。\n6 Evaluate the running results\nAfter the run is complete, the following data can be obtained: Line coverage: Functional coverage: It can be seen that the preset MMIO functions are all covered and correctly triggered.\n","categories":["Example Projects","Learning Materials"],"description":"Overview of the general verification process","excerpt":"Overview of the general verification process","ref":"/mlvp/en/docs/basic/test_dut/","tags":["examples","docs"],"title":"DUT Verification"},{"body":" 本节介绍基于Picker验证DUT的一般流程\n开放验证平台的目标是功能性验证，其一般有以下步骤：\n1. 确定验证对象和目标 通常来说，同时交付给验证工程师的还有DUT的设计文档。此时您需要阅读文档或者源代码，了解验证对象的基本功能、主体结构以及预期功能。\n2. 构建基本验证环境 充分了解设计之后，您需要构建验证的基本环境。例如，除了由Picker生成的DUT外，您可能还需要搭建用于比对的参考模型，也可能需要为后续功能点的评测搭建信号的监听平台。\n3. 功能点与测试点分解 在正式开始验证之前，您还需要提取功能点，并将其进一步分解成测试点。提取和分解方法可以参考：CSDN:芯片验证系列——Testpoints分解\n4. 构造测试用例 有了测试点之后，您需要构造测试用例来覆盖相应的测试点。一个用例可能覆盖多个测试点。\n5. 收集测试结果 运行完所有的测试用例之后，您需要汇总所有的测试结果。一般来说包括代码行覆盖率以及功能覆盖率。前者可以通过Picker工具提供的覆盖率功能获得，后者则需要您通过监听DUT的行为判断某功能是否被用例覆盖到。\n6. 评估测试结果 最后您需要评估得到的结果，如是否存在错误的设计、某功能是否无法被触发、设计文档表述是否与DUT行为一致、设计文档是否表述清晰等。\n接下来我们以果壳Cache的MMIO读写为例，介绍一般验证流程：\n1 确定验证对象和目标：\n果壳Cache的MMIO读写功能。MMIO是一类特殊的IO映射，其支持通过访问内存地址的方式访问IO设备寄存器。由于IO设备的寄存器状态是随时可能改变的，因此不适合将其缓存在cache中。当收到MMIO请求时，果壳cache不会在普通的cache行中查询命中/缺失情况，而是会直接访问MMIO的内存区域来读取或者写入数据。\n2 构建基本验证环境：\n我们可以将验证环境大致分为五个部分：\n1. Testcase Driver：负责由用例产生相应的信号驱动\n2. Monitor：监听信号，判断功能是否被覆盖以及功能是否正确\n3. Ref Cache：一个简单的参考模型\n4. Memory/MMIO Ram：外围设备的模拟，用于模拟相应cache的请求\n5. Nutshell Cache Dut：由Picker生成的DUT\n此外，您可能还需要对DUT的接口做进一步封装以实现更方便的读写请求操作，具体可以参考Nutshll cachewrapper。\n3 功能点与测试点分解：\n果壳cache可以响应MMIO请求，进一步分解可以得到一下测试点：\n测试点1：MMIO请求会被转发到MMIO端口上\n测试点2：cache响应MMIO请求时，不会发出突发传输（Burst Transfer）的请求\n测试点3：cache响应MMIO请求时，会阻塞流水线\n4 构造测试用例： 测试用例的构造是简单的，已知通过创建DUT得到的Nutshell cache的MMIO地址范围是0x30000000~0x7fffffff，则我们只需访问这段内存区间，应当就能获得MMIO的预期结果。需要注意的是，为了触发阻塞流水线的测试点，您可能需要连续地发起请求。\n以下是一个简单的测试用例：\n# import CacheWrapper here def mmio_test(cache: CacheWrapper): mmio_lb\t= 0x30000000 mmio_rb\t= 0x30001000 print(\"\\n[MMIO Test]: Start MMIO Serial Test\") for addr in range(mmio_lb, mmio_rb, 16): addr \u0026= ~(0xf) addr1 = addr addr2 = addr + 4 addr3 = addr + 8 cache.trigger_read_req(addr1) cache.trigger_read_req(addr2) cache.trigger_read_req(addr3) cache.recv() cache.recv() cache.recv() print(\"[MMIO Test]: Finish MMIO Serial Test\") 5 收集测试结果：\n''' In tb_cache.py ''' # import packages here class TestCache(): def setup_class(self): color.print_blue(\"\\nCache Test Start\") self.dut = DUTCache(\"libDPICache.so\") self.dut.init_clock(\"clock\") # Init here # ... self.testlist = [\"mmio_serial\"] def teardown_class(self): self.dut.finalize() color.print_blue(\"\\nCache Test End\") def __reset(self): # Reset cache and devices # MMIO Test def test_mmio(self): if (\"mmio_serial\" in self.testlist): # Run test from ..test.test_mmio import mmio_test mmio_test(self.cache, self.ref_cache) else: print(\"\\nmmio test is not included\") def run(self): self.setup_class() # test self.test_mmio() self.teardown_class() pass if __name__ == \"__main__\": tb = TestCache() tb.run() 运行：\npython3 tb_cache.py 以上仅为大致的运行流程，具体可以参考：Nutshell Cache Verify。\n6 评估运行结果\n运行结束之后可以得到以下数据：\n行覆盖率：\n功能覆盖率：\n可以看到预设的MMIO功能均被覆盖且被正确触发。\n","categories":["示例项目","学习材料"],"description":"介绍验证的一般流程","excerpt":"介绍验证的一般流程","ref":"/mlvp/docs/basic/test_dut/","tags":["examples","docs"],"title":"DUT验证"},{"body":" In traditional chip verification practices, frameworks like UVM are widely adopted.

双端口栈是一种数据结构，支持两个端口同时进行操作。与传统单端口栈相比，双端口栈允许同时进行数据的读写操作，在例如多线程并发读写等场景下，双端口栈能够提供更好的性能。本例中，我们提供了一个简易的双端口栈实现，其源码如下：\nmodule dual_port_stack ( input clk, input rst, // Interface 0 input in0_valid, output

assign out1_cmd = out1_cmd_reg; assign out1_valid = out1_valid_reg; always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin if (rst) begin sp \u003c= 0; busy \u003c= 0; end else begin // Interface 0 Request

在该实现中，除了时钟信号(clk)和复位信号(rst)之外，还包含了两个端口的输入输出信号，它们拥有相同的接口定义。每个端口的信号含义如下：\n请求端口（in） in_valid 输入数据有效信号 in_ready 输入数据准备好信号 in_data 输入数据 in_cmd 输入命令 （0:PUSH, 1:POP） 响应端口（out） out_valid 输出数据有效信号 out_ready 输出数据准备好信号 out_data 输出数据 out_cmd 输出命令 （2:PUSH_OKAY, 3:POP_OKAY） 当我们想通过一个端口对栈进行一次操作时，首先需要将需要的数据和命令写入到输入端口，然后等待输出端口返回结果。\n具体地，如果我们想对栈进行一次 PUSH 操作。首先我们应该将需要 PUSH 的数据写入到 in_data 中，然后将 in_cmd 设置为 0，表示 PUSH 操作，并将 in_valid 置为 1，表示输入数据有效。接着，我们需要等待 in_ready 为 1，保证数据已经正确的被接收，此时 PUSH 请求已经被正确发送。\n命令发送成功后，我们需要在响应端口等待栈的响应信息。当 out_valid 为 1 时，表示栈已经完成了对应的操作，此时我们可以从 out_data 中读取栈的返回数据（POP 操作的返回数据将会放置于此），从 out_cmd 中读取栈的返回命令。当读取到数据后，需要将 out_ready 置为 1，以通知栈正确接收到了返回信息。\n如果两个端口的请求同时有效时，栈将会优先处理端口 0 的请求。\n构建驱动环境 与案例一和案例二类似，在对双端口栈进行测试之前，我们首先需要利用 Picker 工具将 RTL 代码构建为 Python Module。在构建完成后，我们将通过 Python 脚本驱动 RTL 代码进行测试。\n首先，创建名为 dual_port_stack.v 的文件，并将上述的 RTL 代码复制到该文件中，接着在相同文件夹下执行以下命令：\npicker export --autobuild=true dual_port_stack.v -w dual_port_stack.fst --sname dual_port_stack --tdir picker_out_dual_port_stack --lang python -e --sim verilator 生成好的驱动环境位于 picker_out_dual_port_stack 文件夹中, 其中 UT_dual_port_stack 为生成的 Python Module，example.py 为测试脚本。\n可以通过以下命令运行测试脚本：\ncd picker_out_dual_port_stack python3 example.py 若运行过程中无错误发生，则代表环境被正确构建。\n利用协程驱动 DUT 利用回调函数驱动 DUT 在本案例中，为了测试双端口栈的功能，我们需要对其进行驱动。但你可能很快就会发现，仅仅使用案例一和案例二中的方法很难对双端口栈进行驱动。因为在此前的测试中，DUT只有一条执行逻辑，给DUT输入数据后等待DUT输出即可。\n但双端口栈却不同，它的两个端口是两个独立的执行逻辑，在驱动中，这两个端口可能处于完全不同的状态，例如端口0在等待DUT返回数据时，端口1有可能正在发送新的请求。这种情况下，使用简单的串行执行逻辑将很难对DUT进行驱动。\n因此我们在本案例中我们将以双端口栈为例，介绍一种基于回调函数的驱动方法，来完成此类DUT的驱动。\n回调函数简介 回调函数是一种常见的编程技术，它允许我们将一个函数传入，并等待某个条件满足后被调用。构建产生的 Python Module 中，我们提供了向内部执行环境注册回调函数的接口 StepRis，使用方法如下:\nfrom UT_dual_port_stack import DUTdual_port_stack def callback(cycles): print(f\"The current clock cycle is {cycles}\") dut = DUTdual_port_stack() dut.StepRis(callback) dut.Step(10) 你可以直接运行该代码来查看回调函数的效果。\n在上述代码中，我们定义了一个回调函数 callback ，它接受一个参数 cycles ，并在每次调用时打印当前的时钟周期。接着通过 StepRis 将该回调函数注册到 DUT 中。\n注册回调函数后，每运行一次 Step 函数，即每个时钟周期，都会在时钟信号上升沿去调用该回调函数，并传入当前的时钟周期。\n通过这种方式，我们可以将不同的执行逻辑都写成回调函数的方式，并将多个回调函数注册到 DUT 中，从而实现对 DUT 的并行驱动。\n基于回调函数驱动的双端口栈 通过回调函数的形式来完成一条完整的执行逻辑，通常我们会使用状态机的模式进行编写。每调用一次回调函数，就会引起状态机内部的状态变化，多次调用回调函数，就会完成一次完整的执行逻辑。\n下面是一个基于回调函数驱动的双端口栈的示例代码：\nimport random from UT_dual_port_stack import * from enum import Enum class StackModel: def __init__(self): self.stack = [] def commit_push(self, data): self.stack.append(data) print(\"push\", data) def commit_pop(self, dut_data): print(\"Pop\", dut_data) model_data =

self.model.commit_push(self.port_dict[\"in_data\"].value) elif self.status == self.Status.WAIT_RESP_VALID: if self.port_dict[\"out_valid\"].value == 1: self.port_dict[\"out_ready\"].value = 0 self.status = self.Status.IDLE self.remaining_delay = random.randint(0, 5) if self.port_dict[\"out_cmd\"].value == self.BusCMD.POP_OKAY.value: self.model.commit_pop(self.port_dict[\"out_data\"].value) if self.status == self.Status.IDLE: if self.remaining_delay == 0: if self.operation_num \u003c 10: self.push() elif self.operation_num \u003c 20: self.pop() else: return self.operation_num += 1 self.status = self.Status.WAIT_REQ_READY else: self.remaining_delay -= 1 def test_stack(stack): model = StackModel() port0 = SinglePortDriver(stack, model, { \"in_valid\": stack.in0_valid, \"in_ready\": stack.in0_ready, \"in_data\": stack.in0_data, \"in_cmd\": stack.in0_cmd, \"out_valid\": stack.out0_valid, \"out_ready\": stack.out0_ready, \"out_data\": stack.out0_data, \"out_cmd\": stack.out0_cmd, }) port1 = SinglePortDriver(stack, model, { \"in_valid\": stack.in1_valid, \"in_ready\": stack.in1_ready, \"in_data\": stack.in1_data, \"in_cmd\": stack.in1_cmd, \"out_valid\": stack.out1_valid, \"out_ready\": stack.out1_ready, \"out_data\": stack.out1_data, \"out_cmd\": stack.out1_cmd, }) dut.StepRis(port0.step_callback) dut.StepRis(port1.step_callback) dut.Step(200) if __name__ == \"__main__\": dut = DUTdual_port_stack() dut.InitClock(\"clk\") test_stack(dut) dut.Finish() 在上述代码中，实现了这样的驱动过程：每个端口独立对DUT进行驱动，并在一个请求完成后添加随机延迟，每个端口分别完成了 10 次 PUSH 操作与 10 次 POP 操作。\n在 PUSH 或 POP 请求生效时，会调用同一个 StackModel 中的 commit_push 或 commit_pop 函数，以模拟栈的行为，并在每次 POP 操作完成后对比 DUT 的返回数据与模型的数据是否一致。\n为了实现对单个端口的驱动行为，我们实现了 SinglePortDriver 类，其中实现了一个接口进行收发的完整过程，通过 step_callback 函数来实现内部的更新逻辑。\n在测试函数 test_stack 中，我们为双端口栈的每一个端口都创建了一个 SinglePortDriver 实例，传入了对应的接口，并通过 StepRis 函数将其对应的回到函数其注册到 DUT 中。之后调用 dut.Step(200) 时，每个时钟周期中都会自动调用一次回调函数，来完成整个驱动逻辑。\nSinglePortDriver 驱动逻辑\n上面提到，一般使用回调函数的形式需要将执行逻辑实现为状态机，因此在 SinglePortDriver 类中，需要记录包含端口所处的状态，它们分别是：\nIDLE：空闲状态，等待下一次操作 在空闲状态下，需要查看另一个状态 remaining_delay 来判断当前是否已经延时结束，如果延时结束可立即进行下一次操作，否则继续等待。 当需要执行下一次操作时，需要查看状态 operation_num （当前已经执行的操作数）来决定下一次操作时 PUSH 还是 POP。之后调用相关函数对端口进行一次赋值，并将状态切换至 WAIT_REQ_READY。 WAIT_REQ_READY：等待请求端口准备好 当请求发出后（in_valid 有效），此时需要等待 in_ready 信号有效，以确保请求已经被正确接受。 当请求被正确接受后，需要将 in_valid 置为 0，同时将 out_ready 置为 1，表示请求发送完毕，准备好接收回复。 WAIT_RESP_VALID：等待响应端口返回数据 当请求被正确接受后，需要等待 DUT 的回复，即等待 out_valid 信号有效。当 out_valid 信号有效时，表示回复已经产生，一次请求完成，于是将 out_ready 置为 0，同时将状态切换至 IDLE。 运行测试 将上述代码复制到 example.py 中，然后执行以下命令：\ncd picker_out_dual_port_stack python3 example.py 可直接运行本案例的测试代码，你将会看到类似如下的输出：\n... push 77 push 140 push 249 push 68 push 104 push 222 ... Pop 43 Pass: 43 == 43 Pop 211 Pass: 211 == 211 Pop 16 Pass: 16 == 16 Pop 255 Pass: 255 == 255 Pop 222 Pass: 222 == 222 Pop 104 ... 在输出中，你可以看到每次 PUSH 和 POP 操作的数据，以及每次 POP 操作的结果。如果输出中没有错误信息，则表示测试通过。\n回调函数驱动的优劣 通过使用回调函数，我们能够完成对 DUT 的并行驱动，正如本例所示，我们通过两个回调函数实现了对拥有两个独立执行逻辑的端口的驱动。回调函数在简单的场景下，为我们提供了一种简单的并行驱动方法。\n但是通过本例也可以看出，仅仅实现一套简单的“请求-回复”流程，就需要维护大量的内部状态，回调函数将本应完整的执行逻辑拆分为了多次函数调用，为代码的编写和调试增加了诸多复杂性。\n","categories":["示例项目","教程"],"description":"双端口栈是一个拥有两个端口的栈，每个端口都支持push和pop操作。本案例以双端口栈为例，展示如何使用回调函数驱动DUT","excerpt":"双端口栈是一个拥有两个端口的栈，每个端口都支持push和pop操作。本案例以双端口栈为例，展示如何使用回调函数驱动DUT","ref":"/mlvp/docs/quick-start/eg-stack-callback/","tags":["examples","docs"],"title":"案例三：双端口栈（回调）"},{"body":" 在芯片验证的传统实践中，UVM等框架被广泛采用。尽管它们提供了一整套验证方法，但通常只适用于特定的硬件描述语言和仿真环境。本工具突破了这些限制，能够将仿真代码转换成C++或Python，使得我们可以利用软件验证工具来进行更全面的测试。\n因为Python具有强大的生态系统，所以本项目主要以Python作为示例，简单介绍Pytest和Hypothesis两个经典软件测试框架。Pytest以其简洁的语法和丰富的功能，轻松应对各种测试需求。而Hypothesis则通过生成测试用例，揭示出意料之外的边缘情况，提高了测试的全面性和深度。\n我们的项目从一开始就设计为与多种现代软件测试框架兼容。我们鼓励您探索这些工具的潜力，并将其应用于您的测试流程中。通过亲身实践，您将更深刻地理解这些工具如何提升代码的质量和可靠性。让我们一起努力，提高芯片开发的质量。\n","categories":["示例项目","教程"],"description":"可用软件测试框架","excerpt":"可用软件测试框架","ref":"/mlvp/docs/env_usage/frameworks/","tags":["examples","docs"],"title":"集成测试框架"},{"body":"Introduction to the Dual-Port Stack and Environment Setup The dual-port stack used in this case is identical to the one implemented in Case 3. Please refer to the Introduction to the Dual-Port Stack and Driver Environment Setup in Case 3 for more details.\nDriving the DUT Using Coroutines In Case 3, we used callbacks to drive the DUT. While callbacks offer a way to perform parallel operations, they break the execution flow into multiple function calls and require maintaining a large amount of intermediate state, making the code more complex to write and debug.\nIn this case, we will introduce a method of driving the DUT using coroutines. This method not only allows for parallel operations but also avoids the issues associated with callbacks.\nIntroduction to Coroutines Coroutines are a form of “lightweight” threading that enables behavior similar to concurrent execution without the overhead of traditional threads. Coroutines operate on a single-threaded event loop, where multiple coroutines can be defined and added to the event loop, with the event loop managing their scheduling.\nTypically, a defined coroutine will continue to execute until it encounters an event that requires waiting. At this point, the event loop pauses the coroutine and schedules other coroutines to run. Once the event occurs, the event loop resumes the paused coroutine to continue execution.\nFor parallel execution in hardware verification, this behavior is precisely what we need. We can create multiple coroutines to handle various verification tasks. We can treat the clock execution as an event, and within each coroutine, wait for this event. When the clock signal arrives, the event loop wakes up all the waiting coroutines, allowing them to continue executing until they wait for the next clock signal. We use Python’s asyncio to implement coroutine support:\nimport asyncio from UT_dual_port_stack import * async def my_coro(dut, name): for i in range(10): print(f\"{name}: {i}\") await dut.AStep(1) async def test_dut(dut): asyncio.create_task(my_coro(dut, \"coroutine 1\")) asyncio.create_task(my_coro(dut, \"coroutine 2\")) await asyncio.create_task(dut.RunStep(10)) dut = DUTdual_port_stack() dut.InitClock(\"clk\") asyncio.run(test_dut(dut)) dut.Finish() You can run the above code directly to observe the execution of coroutines. In the code, we use create_task to create two coroutine tasks and add them to the event loop. Each coroutine task continuously prints a number and waits for the next clock signal.We use dut.RunStep(10) to create a background clock, which continuously generates clock synchronization signals, allowing other coroutines to continue execution when the clock signal arrives.\nDriving the Dual-Port Stack with Coroutines Using coroutines, we can write the logic for driving each port of the dual-port stack as an independent execution flow without needing to maintain a large amount of intermediate state.\nBelow is a simple verification code using coroutines:\nimport asyncio import random from UT_dual_port_stack import * from enum import Enum class StackModel: def __init__(self): self.stack = [] def commit_push(self, data): self.stack.append(data) print(\"Push\", data) def commit_pop(self, dut_data): print(\"Pop\", dut_data) model_data = self.stack.pop() assert model_data == dut_data, f\"The model data {model_data} is not equal to the dut data {dut_data}\" print(f\"Pass: {model_data} == {dut_data}\") class SinglePortDriver: class BusCMD(Enum): PUSH = 0 POP = 1 PUSH_OKAY = 2 POP_OKAY = 3 def __init__(self, dut, model: StackModel, port_dict): self.dut = dut self.model = model self.port_dict = port_dict async def send_req(self, is_push): self.port_dict[\"in_valid\"].value = 1 self.port_dict[\"in_cmd\"].value = self.BusCMD.PUSH.value if is_push else self.BusCMD.POP.value self.port_dict[\"in_data\"].value = random.randint(0, 2**8-1) await self.dut.AStep(1) await self.dut.Acondition(lambda: self.port_dict[\"in_ready\"].value != 1) self.port_dict[\"in_valid\"].value = 0 if is_push: self.model.commit_push(self.port_dict[\"in_data\"].value) async def receive_resp(self): self.port_dict[\"out_ready\"].value = 1 await self.dut.AStep(1) await self.dut.Acondition(lambda: self.port_dict[\"out_valid\"].value != 1) self.port_dict[\"out_ready\"].value = 0 if self.port_dict[\"out_cmd\"].value == self.BusCMD.POP_OKAY.value: self.model.commit_pop(self.port_dict[\"out_data\"].value) async def exec_once(self, is_push): await self.send_req(is_push) await self.receive_resp() for _ in range(random.randint(0, 5)): await self.dut.AStep(1) async def main(self): for _ in range(10): await self.exec_once(is_push=True) for _ in range(10): await self.exec_once(is_push=False) async def test_stack(stack): model = StackModel() port0 = SinglePortDriver(stack, model, { \"in_valid\": stack.in0_valid, \"in_ready\": stack.in0_ready, \"in_data\": stack.in0_data, \"in_cmd\": stack.in0_cmd, \"out_valid\": stack.out0_valid, \"out_ready\": stack.out0_ready, \"out_data\": stack.out0_data, \"out_cmd\": stack.out0_cmd, }) port1 = SinglePortDriver(stack, model, { \"in_valid\": stack.in1_valid, \"in_ready\": stack.in1_ready, \"in_data\": stack.in1_data, \"in_cmd\": stack.in1_cmd, \"out_valid\": stack.out1_valid, \"out_ready\": stack.out1_ready, \"out_data\": stack.out1_data, \"out_cmd\": stack.out1_cmd, }) asyncio.create_task(port0.main()) asyncio.create_task(port1.main()) await asyncio.create_task(dut.RunStep(200)) if __name__ == \"__main__\": dut = DUTdual_port_stack() dut.InitClock(\"clk\") asyncio.run(test_stack(dut)) dut.Finish() Similar to Case 3, we define a SinglePortDriver class to handle the logic for driving a single port. In the main function, we create two instances of SinglePortDriver, each responsible for driving one of the two ports. We place the driving processes for both ports in the main function and add them to the event loop using asyncio.create_task. Finally, we use dut.RunStep(200) to create a background clock to drive the test. This code implements the same test logic as in Case 3, where each port performs 10 PUSH and 10 POP operations, followed by a random delay after each operation. As you can see, using coroutines eliminates the need to maintain any intermediate state. SinglePortDriver Logic In the SinglePortDriver class, we encapsulate a single operation into the exec_once function. In the main function, we first call exec_once(is_push=True) 10 times to complete the PUSH operations, and then call exec_once(is_push=False) 10 times to complete the POP operations.In the exec_once function, we first call send_req to send a request, then call receive_resp to receive the response, and finally wait for a random number of clock signals to simulate a delay.The send_req and receive_resp functions have similar logic; they set the corresponding input/output signals to the appropriate values and wait for the corresponding signals to become valid. The implementation can be written according to the execution sequence of the ports.Similarly, we use the StackModel class to simulate stack behavior. The commit_push and commit_pop functions simulate the PUSH and POP operations, respectively, with the POP operation comparing the data.\nRunning the Test Copy the above code into example.py and then execute the following commands:\ncd picker_out_dual_port_stack python3 example.py You can run the test code for this case directly, and you will see output similar to the following:\n... Push 141 Push 102 Push 63 Push 172 Push 208 Push 130 Push 151 ... Pop 102 Pass: 102 == 102 Pop 138 Pass: 138 == 138 Pop 56 Pass: 56 == 56 Pop 153 Pass: 153 == 153 Pop 129 Pass: 129 == 129 Pop 235 Pass: 235 == 235 Pop 151 ... In the output, you can see the data for each PUSH and POP operation, as well as the result of each POP operation. If there are no error messages in the output, it indicates that the test passed.\nPros and Cons of Coroutine-Driven Design Using coroutine functions, we can effectively achieve parallel operations while avoiding the issues that come with callback functions. Each independent execution flow can be fully retained as a coroutine, which greatly simplifies code writing.\nHowever, in more complex scenarios, you may find that having many coroutines can make synchronization and timing management between them more complicated. This is especially true when you need to synchronize between two coroutines that do not directly interact with the DUT. At this point, you’ll need a set of coroutine writing standards and design patterns for verification code to help you write coroutine-based verification code more effectively. Therefore, we provide the mlvp library, which offers a set of design patterns for coroutine-based verification code. You can learn more about mlvp and how it can help you write better verification code by visiting here .\n","categories":["Example Projects","Tutorials"],"description":"The dual-port stack is a stack with two ports, each supporting push and pop operations.

在案例三中，我们使用了回调函数的方式来驱动DUT，回调函数虽然给我们提供了一种能够完成并行操作的方式，然而其却把完成的执行流程割裂为多次函数调用，并需要维护大量中间状态，导致代码的编写及调试变得较为复杂。\n在本案例中，我们将会介绍一种通过协程驱动的方法，这种方法不仅能够做到并行操作，同时能够很好地避免回调函数所带来的问题。\n协程简介 协程是一种“轻量级”的线程，通过协程，你可以实现与线程相似的并发执行的行为，但其开销却远小于线程。其实现原理是，协程库实现了一个运行于单线程之上的事件循环（EventLoop），程序员可以定义若干协程并且加入到事件循环，由事件循环负责这些协程的调度。\n一般来说，我们定义的协程在执行过程中会持续执行，直到遇到一个需要等待的“事件”，此时事件循环就会暂停执行该协程，并调度其他协程运行。当事件发生后，事件循环会再次唤醒该协程，继续执行。\n对于硬件验证中的并行执行来说，这种特性正是我们所需要的，我们可以创建多个协程，来完成验证中的多个驱动任务。我们可以将时钟的执行当做事件，在每个协程中等待这个事件，当时钟信号到来时，事件循环会唤醒所有等待的协程，使其继续执行，直到他们等待下一个时钟信号。\n我们用 Python 中的 asyncio 来实现对协程的支持：\nimport asyncio from UT_dual_port_stack import * async def my_coro(dut, name): for i in range(10): print(f\"{name}: {i}\") await dut.AStep(1) async def test_dut(dut): asyncio.create_task(my_coro(dut, \"coroutine 1\")) asyncio.create_task(my_coro(dut, \"coroutine 2\")) await asyncio.create_task(dut.RunStep(10)) dut = DUTdual_port_stack() dut.InitClock(\"clk\") asyncio.run(test_dut(dut)) dut.Finish() 你可以直接运行上述代码来观察协程的执行过程。在上述代码中我们用 create_task 创建了两个协程任务并加入到事件循环中，每个协程任务中，会不断打印一个数字并等待下一个时钟信号到来。\n我们使用 dut.RunStep(10) 来创建一个后台时钟，它会不断产生时钟同步信号，使得其他协程能够在时钟信号到来时继续执行。\n基于协程驱动的双端口栈 利用协程，我们就可以将驱动双端口栈中单个端口逻辑写成一个独立的执行流，不需要再去维护大量的中间状态。\n下面是我们提供的一个简单的使用协程驱动的验证代码：\nimport asyncio import random from UT_dual_port_stack import * from enum import Enum class StackModel: def __init__(self): self.stack = [] def commit_push(self, data): self.stack.append(data) print(\"Push\", data) def commit_pop(self, dut_data): print(\"Pop\", dut_data) model_data = self.stack.pop() assert model_data == dut_data, f\"The model data {model_data} is not equal to the dut data {dut_data}\" print(f\"Pass: {model_data} == {dut_data}\") class SinglePortDriver: class BusCMD(Enum): PUSH = 0 POP = 1 PUSH_OKAY = 2 POP_OKAY = 3 def __init__(self, dut, model: StackModel, port_dict): self.dut = dut self.model = model self.port_dict = port_dict

self.port_dict[\"in_data\"].value = random.randint(0, 2**8-1) await self.dut.AStep(1) await self.dut.Acondition(lambda: self.port_dict[\"in_ready\"].value != 1) self.port_dict[\"in_valid\"].value = 0 if is_push: self.model.commit_push(self.port_dict[\"in_data\"].value) async def receive_resp(self): self.port_dict[\"out_ready\"].value = 1 await self.dut.AStep(1) await self.dut.Acondition(lambda: self.port_dict[\"out_valid\"].value != 1) self.port_dict[\"out_ready\"].value = 0 if self.port_dict[\"out_cmd\"].value == self.BusCMD.POP_OKAY.value: self.model.commit_pop(self.port_dict[\"out_data\"].value) async def exec_once(self, is_push): await self.send_req(is_push) await self.receive_resp() for _ in range(random.randint(0, 5)): await self.dut.AStep(1) async def main(self): for _ in range(10): await self.exec_once(is_push=True) for _ in range(10): await self.exec_once(is_push=False) async def test_stack(stack): model = StackModel() port0 = SinglePortDriver(stack, model, { \"in_valid\": stack.in0_valid, \"in_ready\": stack.in0_ready, \"in_data\": stack.in0_data, \"in_cmd\": stack.in0_cmd, \"out_valid\": stack.out0_valid, \"out_ready\": stack.out0_ready, \"out_data\": stack.out0_data, \"out_cmd\": stack.out0_cmd, }) port1 = SinglePortDriver(stack, model, { \"in_valid\": stack.in1_valid, \"in_ready\": stack.in1_ready, \"in_data\": stack.in1_data, \"in_cmd\": stack.in1_cmd, \"out_valid\": stack.out1_valid, \"out_ready\": stack.out1_ready, \"out_data\": stack.out1_data, \"out_cmd\": stack.out1_cmd, }) asyncio.create_task(port0.main()) asyncio.create_task(port1.main()) await asyncio.create_task(dut.RunStep(200)) if __name__ == \"__main__\": dut = DUTdual_port_stack() dut.InitClock(\"clk\") asyncio.run(test_stack(dut)) dut.Finish() 与案例三类似，我们定义了一个 SinglePortDriver 类，用于驱动单个端口的逻辑。在 main 函数中，我们创建了两个 SinglePortDriver 实例，分别用于驱动两个端口。我们将两个端口的驱动过程放在了入口函数 main 中，并通过 asyncio.create_task 将其加入到事件循环中，在最后我们通过 dut.RunStep(200) 来创建了后台时钟，以推动测试的进行。\n该代码实现了与案例三一致的测试逻辑，即在每个端口中对栈进行 10 次 PUSH 和 10 次 POP 操作，并在操作完成后添加随机延迟。但你可以清晰的看到，利用协程进行编写，不需要维护任何的中间状态。\nSinglePortDriver 逻辑\n在 SinglePortDriver 类中，我们将一次操作封装为 exec_once 这一个函数，在 main 函数中只需要首先调用 10 次 exec_once(is_push=True) 来完成 PUSH 操作，再调用 10 次 exec_once(is_push=False) 来完成 POP 操作即可。\n在 exec_once 函数中，我们首先调用 send_req 函数来发送请求，然后调用 receive_resp 函数来接收响应，最后通过等待随机次数的时钟信号来模拟延迟。\nsend_req 和 receive_resp 函数的实现逻辑类似，只需要将对应的输入输出信号设置为对应的值，然后等待对应的信号变为有效即可，可以完全根据端口的执行顺序来编写。\n类似地，我们使用 StackModel 类来模拟栈的行为，在 commit_push 和 commit_pop 函数中分别模拟了 PUSH 和 POP 操作，并在 POP 操作中进行了数据的比较。\n运行测试 将上述代码复制到 example.py 中，然后执行以下命令：\ncd picker_out_dual_port_stack python3 example.py 可直接运行本案例的测试代码，你将会看到类似如下的输出：\n... Push 141 Push 102 Push 63 Push 172 Push 208 Push 130 Push 151 ... Pop 102 Pass: 102 == 102 Pop 138 Pass: 138 == 138 Pop 56 Pass: 56 == 56 Pop 153 Pass: 153 == 153 Pop 129 Pass: 129 == 129 Pop 235 Pass: 235 == 235 Pop 151 ... 在输出中，你可以看到每次 PUSH 和 POP 操作的数据，以及每次 POP 操作的结果。如果输出中没有错误信息，则表示测试通过。\n协程驱动的优劣 通过协程函数，我们可以很好地实现并行操作，同时避免了回调函数所带来的问题。每个独立的执行流都能被完整保留，实现为一个协程，大大方便了代码的编写。\n然而，在更为复杂的场景下你会发现，实现了众多协程，会使得协程之间的同步和时序管理变得复杂。尤其是你需要在两个不与DUT直接交互的协程之间进行同步时，这种现象会尤为明显。\n在这时候，你就需要一套协程编写的规范以及验证代码的设计模式，来帮助你更好地编写基于协程的验证代码。因此，我们提供了 mlvp 库，它提供了一套基于协程的验证代码设计模式，你可以通过使用 mlvp 来更好地编写验证代码，你可以在这里去进一步了解 mlvp。\n","categories":["示例项目","教程"],"description":"双端口栈是一个拥有两个端口的栈，每个端口都支持push和pop操作。本案例以双端口栈为例，展示如何使用协程驱动DUT","excerpt":"双端口栈是一个拥有两个端口的栈，每个端口都支持push和pop操作。本案例以双端口栈为例，展示如何使用协程驱动DUT","ref":"/mlvp/docs/quick-start/eg-stack-async/","tags":["examples","docs"],"title":"案例四：双端口栈（协程）"},{"body":" 在我们完成DUT验证后，编写验证报告是至关重要的一环。本节将从整体角度概述验证报告的结构以及报告所需覆盖的内容。\n验证报告是对整个验证过程的回顾，是验证合理与否的重要支持文件。一般情况下，验证报告需要包含以下内容：\n文档基本信息（作者、日志、版本等） 验证对象（验证目标） 功能点介绍 验证方案 测试点分解 测试用例 测试环境 结果分析 缺陷分析 测试结论 以下内容对列表进行进一步解释，具体示例可以参考nutshell_cache_report_demo.pdf\n1. 基本信息 应当包括作者、日志、版本、日期等。\n2. 验证对象（验证目标） 需要对您的验证对象做必要的介绍，可以包括其结构、基本功能、接口信息等。\n3. 功能点介绍 通过阅读设计文档或者源码，您需要总结DUT的目标功能，并将其细化为各功能点。\n4. 验证方案 应当包括您计划的验证流程以及验证框架。同时，您也应当接受您的框架各部分是如何协同工作的。\n5. 测试点分解 针对功能点提出的测试方法。具体可以包括在怎样的信号输入下应当观测到怎样的信号输出。\n6. 测试用例 测试点的具体实现。一个测试用例可以包括多个测试点。\n7. 测试环境 包括硬件信息、软件版本信息等。\n8. 结果分析 结果分析一般指覆盖率分析。通常来说应当考虑两类覆盖率：\n1. 行覆盖率： 在测试用例中有多少RTL行代码被执行。一般来说我们要求行覆盖率在98%以上。\n2. 功能覆盖率：根据相应的信号判断您提取的功能点是否被覆盖且被正确触发。一般我们要求测试用例覆盖每个功能点。\n9. 缺陷分析 对DUT存在的缺陷进行分析。可以包括设计文档的规范性和详细性、DUT功能的正确性（是否存在bug）、DUT功能是否能被触发等方面。\n10. 验证结论 验证结论是在完成芯片验证过程后得出的最终结论，是对以上内容的总结。\n","categories":["示例项目","学习材料"],"description":"概述验证报告的结构与内容。","excerpt":"概述验证报告的结构与内容。","ref":"/mlvp/docs/basic/report/","tags":["examples","docs"],"title":"验证报告"},{"body":"","categories":["Sample Projects","Tutorials"],"description":"The Open Verification Platform supports multiple languages.","excerpt":"The Open Verification Platform supports multiple languages.","ref":"/mlvp/en/docs/multi-lang/","tags":["examples","docs"],"title":"Multi-language Support"},{"body":"","categories":["示例项目","教程"],"description":"开放验证平台支持多种语言","excerpt":"开放验证平台支持多种语言","ref":"/mlvp/docs/multi-lang/","tags":["examples","docs"],"title":"多语言支持"},{"body":" This learning resource introduces the basic concepts and techniques related to verification, as well as how to use the open-source tools provided by this project for chip verification.\nBefore studying this material, it is assumed that you already have basic knowledge of Linux, Python, etc.\nRelevant learning materials:\n《Linux 101》Online Lecture Notes Python Official Python Tutorial Official Python Tutorial If you plan to participate in the “Open Source Verification Projects” published on this platform, it is recommended to complete the study of this material in advance.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" This learning resource introduces the basic concepts and techniques …","ref":"/mlvp/en/docs/","tags":"","title":"Learning Resources"},{"body":" 本学习资源介绍验证相关的基本概念、技术，以及如何使用本项目提供的开源工具进行芯片验证\n学习本材料前，假定您已经拥有linux、python等相关基础知识。\n相关学习材料：\n《Linux 101》在线讲义 Python官方教程 Javatpoint上的Git基础 若计划参与本平台上发布的“开源开放验证项目”，建议提前完本材料的学习。\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" 本学习资源介绍验证相关的基本概念、技术，以及如何使用本项目提供的开源工具进行芯片验证\n学习本材料前，假定您已经拥有linux、python …","ref":"/mlvp/docs/","tags":"","title":"学习资源"},{"body":"Software Testing Before we start with pytest, let’s understand software testing. Software testing generally involves the following four aspects:\nUnit Testing: Also known as module testing, it involves checking the correctness of program modules, which are the smallest units in software design. Integration Testing: Also known as assembly testing, it usually builds on unit testing by sequentially and incrementally testing all program modules, focusing on the interface parts of different modules. System Testing: It treats the entire software system as a whole for testing, including testing the functionality, performance, and the software’s running environment. Acceptance Testing: Refers to testing the entire system according to the project task book, contract, and acceptance criteria agreed upon by both the supply and demand sides, to determine whether to accept or reject the system. pytest was initially designed as a unit testing framework, but it also provides many features that allow it to be used for a wider range of testing, including integration testing and system testing. It is a very mature full-featured Python testing framework. It simplifies test writing and execution by collecting test functions and modules and providing a rich assertion library. It is a very mature and powerful Python testing framework with the following key features:\nSimple and Flexible: Pytest is easy to get started with and is flexible. Supports Parameterization: You can easily provide different parameters for test cases. Full-featured: Pytest not only supports simple unit testing but can also handle complex functional testing. You can even use it for automation testing, such as Selenium or Appium testing, as well as interface automation testing (combining Pytest with the Requests library). Rich Plugin Ecosystem: Pytest has many third-party plugins, and you can also customize extensions. Some commonly used plugins include: pytest-selenium: Integrates Selenium. pytest-html: Generates HTML test reports. pytest-rerunfailures: Repeats test cases in case of failure. pytest-xdist: Supports multi-CPU distribution. Well Integrated with Jenkins. Supports Allure Report Framework. This article will briefly introduce the usage of pytest based on testing requirements. The complete manual is available here for students to study in depth.\nInstalling Pytest # Install pytest: pip install pytest # Upgrade pytest pip install -U pytest # Check pytest version pytest --version # Check installed package list pip list # Check pytest help documentation pytest -h # Install third-party plugins pip install pytest-sugar pip install pytest-rerunfailures pip install pytest-xdist pip install pytest-assume pip install pytest-html Using Pytest Naming Convention # When using pytest, our module names are usually prefixed with test or end with test. You can also modify the configuration file to customize the naming convention. # test_*.py or *_test.py test_demo1 demo2_test # The class name in the module must start with Test and cannot have an init method. class TestDemo1: class TestLogin: # The test methods defined in the class must start with test_ test_demo1(self) test_demo2(self) # Test Case class test_one: def test_demo1(self): print(\"Test Case 1\") def test_demo2(self): print(\"Test Case 2\") Pytest Parameters pytest supports many parameters, which can be viewed using the help command.\npytest -help Here are some commonly used ones:\n-m: Specify multiple tag names with an expression. pytest provides a decorator @pytest.mark.xxx for marking tests and grouping them (xxx is the group name you defined), so you can quickly select and run them, with different groups separated by and or or.\n-v: Outputs more detailed information during runtime. Without -v, the runtime does not display the specific test case names being run; with -v, it prints out the specific test cases in the console.\n-q: Similar to the verbosity in unittest, used to simplify the runtime output. When running tests with -q, only simple runtime information is displayed, for example:\n.s.. [100%] 3 passed, 1 skipped in 9.60s -k: You can run specified test cases using an expression. It is a fuzzy match, with and or or separating keywords, and the matching range includes file names, class names, and function names.\n-x: Exit the test if one test case fails. This is very useful for debugging. When a test fails, stop running the subsequent tests.\n-s: Display print content. When running test scripts, we often add some print content for debugging or printing some content. However, when running pytest, this content is not displayed. If you add -s, it will be displayed.\npytest test_se.py -s Selecting Test Cases to Execute with Pytest In Pytest, you can select and execute test cases based on different dimensions such as test folders, test files, test classes, and test methods.\nExecute by test folder # Execute all test cases in the current folder and subfolders pytest . # Execute all test cases in the tests folder and its subfolders, which are at the same level as the current folder pytest ../tests # Execute by test file # Run all test cases in test_se.py pytest test_se.py # Execute by test class, must be in the following format: pytest file_name.py::TestClass, where \"::\" is the separator used to separate the test module and test class. # Run all test cases under the class named TestSE in the test_se.py file pytest test_se.py::TestSE # Execute by test method, must be in the following format: pytest file_name.py::TestClass::TestMethod, where \"::\" is the separator used to separate the test module, test class, and test method. # Run the test case named test_get_new_message under the class named TestSE in the test_se.py file pytest test_se.py::TestSE::test_get_new_message # The above methods of selecting test cases are all on the **command line**. If you want to execute directly in the test program, you can directly call pytest.main(), the format is: pytest.main([module.py::class::method]) In addition, Pytest also supports multiple ways to control the execution of test cases, such as filtering execution, running in multiple processes, retrying execution, etc.\nWriting Validation with Pytest During testing, we use the previously validated adder.

[100%] 3 passed, 1 skipped in 9.60s -k: 可以通过表达式运行指定的测试用例。 它是一种模糊匹配，用 and 或 or 区分各个关键字，匹配范围有文件名、类名、函数名。\n-x: 出现一条测试用例失败就退出测试。 在调试时，这个功能非常有用。当出现测试失败时，停止运行后续的测试。\n-s: 显示print内容 在运行测试脚本时，为了调试或打印一些内容，我们会在代码中加一些print内容，但是在运行pytest时，这些内容不会显示出来。如果带上-s，就可以显示了。\npytest test_se.py -s Pytest 选择测试用例执行 在 Pytest 中，您可以按照测试文件夹、测试文件、测试类和测试方法的不同维度来选择执行测试用例。\n按照测试文件夹执行 # 执行所有当前文件夹及子文件夹下的所有测试用例 pytest . # 执行跟当前文件夹同级的tests文件夹及子文件夹下的所有测试用例 pytest ../tests # 按照测试文件执行 # 运行test_se.py下的所有的测试用例 pytest test_se.py # 按照测试类执行，必须以如下格式： pytest 文件名 .py:: 测试类，其中“::”是分隔符，用于分割测试module和测试类。 # 运行test_se.py文件下的，类名是TestSE下的所有测试用例 pytest test_se.py::TestSE # 测试方法执行，必须以如下格式： pytest 文件名 .py:: 测试类 :: 测试方法，其中 “::” 是分隔符，用于分割测试module、测试类，以及测试方法。 # 运行test_se.py文件下的，类名是TestSE下的，名字为test_get_new_message的测试用例 pytest test_se.py::TestSE::test_get_new_message # 以上选择测试用例的方法均是在**命令行**，如果您想直接在测试程序里执行可以直接在main函数中**调用pytest.main()**,其格式为： pytest.main([模块.py::类::方法]) 此外，Pytest 还支持控制测试用例执行的多种方式，例如过滤执行、多进程运行、重试运行等。\n使用Pytest编写验证 在测试过程中，我们使用之前验证过的加法器，进入Adder文件夹，在picker_out_adder目录下新建一个test_adder.py文件，内容如下： # 导入测试模块和所需的库 from UT_Adder import * import pytest import ctypes import random # 使用 pytest fixture 来初始化和清理资源 @pytest.fixture def adder(): # 创建 DUTAdder 实例，加载动态链接库 dut = DUTAdder() # 执行一次时钟步进，准备 DUT dut.Step(1) # yield 语句之后的代码会在测试结束后执行，用于清理资源 yield dut # 清理DUT资源，并生成测试覆盖率报告和波形 dut.Finish() class TestFullAdder: # 将 full_adder 定义为静态方法，因为它不依赖于类实例 @staticmethod def full_adder(a, b, cin): cin = cin \u0026 0b1 Sum = ctypes.c_uint64(a).value Sum += ctypes.c_uint64(b).value + cin Cout = (Sum \u003e\u003e 64) \u0026 0b1 Sum \u0026= 0xffffffffffffffff return Sum, Cout # 使用 pytest.mark.usefixtures 装饰器指定使用的 fixture @pytest.mark.usefixtures(\"adder\") # 定义测试方法，adder 参数由 pytest 通过 fixture 注入 def test_adder(self, adder): # 进行多次随机测试 for _ in range(114514): # 随机生成 64 位的 a 和 b，以及 1 位的进位 cin a = random.getrandbits(64) b = random.getrandbits(64) cin = random.getrandbits(1) # 设置 DUT 的输入 adder.a.value = a adder.b.value = b adder.cin.value = cin # 执行一次时钟步进 adder.Step(1) # 使用静态方法计算预期结果 sum, cout = self.full_adder(a, b, cin) # 断言 DUT 的输出与预期结果相同 assert sum == adder.sum.value assert cout == adder.cout.value if __name__ == \"__main__\": pytest.main(['-v', 'test_adder.py::TestFullAdder']) 运行测试之后输出如下： collected 1 item test_adder.py ✓ 100% ██████████ Results (4.33s): 测试成功表明，在经过114514次循环之后，我们的设备暂时没有发现bug。然而，使用多次循环的随机数生成测试用例会消耗大量资源，并且这些随机生成的测试用例可能无法有效覆盖所有边界条件。在下一部分，我们将介绍一种更有效的测试用例生成方法。\n","categories":["示例项目","教程"],"description":"可用来管理测试，生成测试报告","excerpt":"可用来管理测试，生成测试报告","ref":"/mlvp/docs/env_usage/frameworks/pytest/","tags":["examples","docs"],"title":"PyTest"},{"body":"Hypothesis In the previous section, we manually wrote test cases and specified inputs and expected outputs for each case. This method has some issues, such as incomplete test case coverage and the tendency to overlook boundary conditions. Hypothesis is a Python library for property-based testing. Its main goal is to make testing simpler, faster, and more reliable. It uses a method called property-based testing, where you can write some hypotheses for your code, and Hypothesis will automatically generate test cases to verify these hypotheses. This makes it easier to write comprehensive and efficient tests. Hypothesis can automatically generate various types of input data, including basic types (e.g., integers, floats, strings), container types (e.g., lists, sets, dictionaries), and custom types. It tests based on the properties (assertions) you provide. If a test fails, it will try to narrow down the input data to find the smallest failing case. With Hypothesis, you can better cover the boundary conditions of your code and uncover errors you might not have considered. This helps improve the quality and reliability of your code.\nBasic Concepts Test Function: The function or method to be tested. Properties: Conditions that the test function should satisfy. Properties are applied to the test function as decorators. Strategy: A generator for test data. Hypothesis provides a range of built-in strategies, such as integers, strings, lists, etc. You can also define custom strategies. Test Generator: A function that generates test data based on strategies. Hypothesis automatically generates test data and passes it as parameters to the test function. This article will briefly introduce Hypothesis based on testing requirements. The complete manual is available for in-depth study.\nInstallation Install with pip and import in Python to use:\npip install hypothesis import hypothesis Basic Usage Properties and Strategies Hypothesis uses property decorators to define the properties of test functions. The most common decorator is @given, which specifies the properties the test function should satisfy. We can define a test function test_addition using the @given decorator and add properties to x. The test generator will automatically generate test data for the function and pass it as parameters, for example:\ndef addition(number: int) -\u003e int: return number + 1 @given(x=integers(), y=integers())　def test_addition(x, y):　assert x + 1 == addition（1） In this example, integers() is a built-in strategy for generating integer test data. Hypothesis offers a variety of built-in strategies for generating different types of test data. Besides integers(), there are strategies for strings, booleans, lists, dictionaries, etc. For instance, using the text() strategy to generate string test data and using lists(text()) to generate lists of strings:\n@given(s=text(), l=lists(text())) def test_string_concatenation(s, l):　result = s + \"\".join(l)　assert len(result) == len(s) + sum(len(x) for x in l) You can also define custom strategies to generate specific types of test data, for example, a strategy for non-negative integers:\ndef non_negative_integers(): return integers(min_value=0) @given(x=non_negative_integers()) def test_positive_addition(x): assert x + 1 \u003e x Expectations We can use expect to specify the expected result of a function:\n@given(x=integers()) def test_addition(x): expected = x + 1 actual = addition(x) Hypotheses and Assertions When using Hypothesis for testing, we can use standard Python assertions to verify the properties of the test function. Hypothesis will automatically generate test data and run the test function based on the properties defined in the decorator. If an assertion fails, Hypothesis will try to narrow down the test data to find the smallest failing case.\nSuppose we have a string reversal function. We can use an assert statement to check if reversing a string twice equals itself:\ndef test_reverse_string(s): expected = x + 1 actual = addition(x) assert actual == expected Writing Tests Tests in Hypothesis consist of two parts: a function that looks like a regular test in your chosen framework but with some extra parameters, and a @given decorator specifying how to provide those parameters. Here’s an example of how to use it to verify a full adder, which we tested previously:\nBased on the previous section’s code, we modify the method of generating test cases from random numbers to the integers() method. The modified code is as follows:\nfrom UT_Adder import * import pytest import ctypes import random from hypothesis import given, strategies as st # Initializing and Cleaning Up Resources Using pytest Fixture from UT_Adder import * import pytest import ctypes from hypothesis import given, strategies as st # Using pytest fixture to initialize and clean up resources @pytest.fixture(scope=\"class\") def adder(): # Create DUTAdder instance and load dynamic library dut = DUTAdder() # Perform a clock step to prepare the DUT dut.Step(1) # Code after yield executes after tests finish, for cleanup yield dut # Clean up DUT resources and generate coverage report and waveform dut.finalize() class TestFullAdder: # Define full_adder as a static method, as it doesn't depend on class instance @staticmethod def full_adder(a, b, cin): cin = cin \u0026 0b1 Sum = ctypes.c_uint64(a).value Sum += ctypes.c_uint64(b).value + cin Cout = (Sum \u003e\u003e 64) \u0026 0b1 Sum \u0026= 0xffffffffffffffff return Sum, Cout # Use Hypothesis to automatically generate test cases @given( a=st.integers(min_value=0, max_value=0xffffffffffffffff), b=st.integers(min_value=0, max_value=0xffffffffffffffff), cin=st.integers(min_value=0, max_value=1) ) # Define test method, adder parameter injected by pytest via fixture def test_full_adder_with_hypothesis(self, adder, a, b, cin): # Calculate expected sum and carry sum_expected, cout_expected = self.full_adder(a, b, cin) # Set DUT inputs adder.a.value = a adder.b.value = b adder.cin.value = cin # Perform a clock step adder.Step(1) # Assert DUT outputs match expected results assert sum_expected == adder.sum.value assert cout_expected == adder.cout.value if __name__ == \"__main__\": # Run specified tests in verbose mode pytest.main(['-v', 'test_adder.py::TestFullAdder']) In this example, the @given decorator and strategies are used to generate random data that meets specified conditions. st.integers() is a strategy for generating integers within a specified range, used to generate numbers between 0 and 0xffffffffffffffff for a and b, and between 0 and 1 for cin. Hypothesis will automatically rerun this test multiple times, each time using different random inputs, helping reveal potential boundary conditions or edge cases.\nRun the tests, and the output will be as follows: collected 1 item test_adder.py ✓ 100% ██████████ Results (0.42s): 1 passed As we can see, the tests were completed in a short amount of time.\n","categories":["Sample Projects","Tutorials"],"description":"Can Be Used to Generate Stimuli","excerpt":"Can Be Used to Generate Stimuli","ref":"/mlvp/en/docs/env_usage/frameworks/hypothesis/","tags":["examples","docs"],"title":"Hypothesis"},{"body":"Hypothesis 在上一节中，我们通过手动编写测试用例，并为每个用例指定输入和预期输出。这种方式存在一些问题，例如测试用例覆盖不全面、边界条件 容易被忽略等。它是一个用于属性基于断言的软件测试的 Python 库。Hypothesis 的主要目标是使测试更简单、更快速、更可靠。它使用了一种称为属性基于断言的测试方法，即你可以为你的代码编写一些假（hypotheses），然后 Hypothesis 将会自动生成测试用例并验证这些假设。这使得编写全面且高效的测试变得更加容易。Hypothesis 可以自动生成各种类型的输入数据，包括基本类型（例如整数、浮点数、字符串等）、容器类型（例如列表、集合、字典等）、自定义类型等。然后，它会根据你提供的属性（即断言）进行测试，如果发现测试失败，它将尝试缩小输入数据的范围以找出最小的失败案例。通过 Hypothesis，你可以更好地覆盖代码的边界条件，并发现那些你可能没有考虑到的错误情况。这有助于提高代码的质量和可靠性。\n基本概念 测试函数：即待测试的函数或方法，我们需要对其进行测试。 属性：定义了测试函数应该满足的条件。属性是以装饰器的形式应用于测试函数上的。 策略：用于生成测试数据的生成器。Hypothesis 提供了一系列内置的策略，如整数、字符串、列表等。我们也可以自定义策略。 测试生成器：基于策略生成测试数据的函数。Hypothesis 会自动为我们生成测试数据，并将其作为参数传递给测试函数。 本文将基于测试需求简单介绍Hypothesis的用法，其完整手册在这里，供同学们进行深入学习。\n安装 使用pip安装，在python中导入即可使用\npip install hypothesis import hypothesis 基本用法 属性和策略 Hypothesis 使用属性装饰器来定义测试函数的属性。最常用的装饰器是 @given，它指定了测试函数应该满足的属性。 我们可以通过@given 装饰器定义了一个测试函数 test_addition。并给x 添加对应的属性，测试生成器会自动为测试函数生成测试数据，并将其作为参数传递给函数，例如\ndef addition(number: int) -\u003e int: return number + 1 @given(x=integers(), y=integers())　def test_addition(x, y):　assert x + 1 == addition（1） 其中integers () 是一个内置的策略，用于生成整数类型的测试数据。Hypothesis 提供了丰富的内置策略，用于生成各种类型的测试数据。除了integers ()之外，还有字符串、布尔值、列表、字典等策略。例如使用 text () 策略生成字符串类型的测试数据，使用 lists (text ()) 策略生成字符串列表类型的测试数据\n@given(s=text(), l=lists(text())) def test_string_concatenation(s, l):　result = s + \"\".join(l)　assert len(result) == len(s) + sum(len(x) for x in l) 除了可以使用内置的策略以外，还可以使用自定义策略来生成特定类型的测试数据，例如我们可以生产一个非负整形的策略\ndef non_negative_integers(): return integers(min_value=0) @given(x=non_negative_integers()) def test_positive_addition(x): assert x + 1 \u003e x 期望 我们可以通过expect 来指明需要的函数期待得到的结果\n@given(x=integers()) def test_addition(x): expected = x + 1 actual = addition(x) 假设和断言 在使用 Hypothesis 进行测试时，我们可以使用标准的 Python 断言来验证测试函数的属性。Hypothesis 会自动为我们生成测试数据，并根据属性装饰器中定义的属性来运行测试函数。如果断言失败，Hypothesis 会尝试缩小测试数据的范围，以找出导致失败的最小样例。\n假如我们有一个字符串反转函数，我们可以通过assert 来判断翻转两次后他是不是等于自身\ndef test_reverse_string(s): expected = x + 1 actual = addition(x) assert actual == expected 编写测试 Hypothesis 中的测试由两部分组成：一个看起来像您选择的测试框架中的常规测试但带有一些附加参数的函数，以及一个@given指定如何提供这些参数的装饰器。以下是如何使用它来验证我们之前验证过的全加器的示例：\n在上一节的代码基础上，我们进行一些修改，将生成测试用例的方法从随机数修改为integers ()方法，修改后的代码如下：\nfrom UT_Adder import * import pytest import ctypes import random from hypothesis import given, strategies as st #
