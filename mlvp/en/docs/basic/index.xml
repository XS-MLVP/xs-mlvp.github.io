      <description>This page provides a brief introduction to chip verification, including concepts used in examples such as DUT (Design Under Test) and RM (Reference Model).&#xA;The chip verification process needs to align with the actual situation of the company or team. There is no absolute standard that meets all requirements and must be referenced.&#xA;What is Chip Verification? The chip design-to-production process involves three main stages: chip design, chip manufacturing, and chip packaging/testing.</description>

      <description>This page introduces the basics of digital circuits. Digital circuits use digital signals and are the foundation of most modern computers.&#xA;What Are Digital Circuits Digital circuits are electronic circuits that use two discrete voltage levels to represent information. Typically, digital circuits use two power supply voltages to indicate high (H) and low (L) levels, representing the digits 1 and 0 respectively. This representation uses binary signals to transmit and process information.</description>

      <description>Using Guoke Cache as an example, this document introduces how to create a DUT based on Chisel.&#xA;In this document, a DUT (Design Under Test) refers to the circuit or system being verified during the chip verification process. The DUT is the primary subject of verification. When creating a DUT based on the picker tool, it is essential to consider the functionality, performance requirements, and verification goals of the subject under test.</description>

      <description>This section introduces the general process of verifying a DUT based on Picker.&#xA;The goal of the open verification platform is functional verification, which generally involves the following steps:&#xA;1. Determine the verification object and goals Typically, the design documentation of the DUT is also delivered to the verification engineer. At this point, you need to read the documentation or source code to understand the basic functions, main structure, and expected functionalities of the verification object.</description>

      <description>After we complete the DUT verification, writing a verification report is a crucial step. This section will provide an overview of the structure of the verification report and the content that needs to be covered.&#xA;The verification report is a review of the entire verification process and an important supporting document for determining the reasonableness of the verification. Generally, the verification report should include the following content:&#xA;Basic document information (author, log, version, etc.</description>
