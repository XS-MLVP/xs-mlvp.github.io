      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;software-testing&#34;&gt;Software Testing&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before we start with pytest, let&amp;rsquo;s understand software testing. Software testing generally involves the following four aspects:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Unit Testing: Also known as module testing, it involves checking the correctness of program modules, which are the smallest units in software design.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Integration Testing: Also known as assembly testing, it usually builds on unit testing by sequentially and incrementally testing all program modules, focusing on the interface parts of different modules.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;System Testing: It treats the entire software system as a whole for testing, including testing the functionality, performance, and the software&amp;rsquo;s running environment.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Acceptance Testing: Refers to testing the entire system according to the project task book, contract, and acceptance criteria agreed upon by both the supply and demand sides, to determine whether to accept or reject the system.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;pytest was initially designed as a unit testing framework, but it also provides many features that allow it to be used for a wider range of testing, including integration testing and system testing. It is a very mature full-featured Python testing framework.&#xA;It simplifies test writing and execution by collecting test functions and modules and providing a rich assertion library. It is a very mature and powerful Python testing framework with the following key features:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hypothesis</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;hypothesis&#34;&gt;Hypothesis&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the previous section, we manually wrote test cases and specified inputs and expected outputs for each case. This method has some issues, such as incomplete test case coverage and the tendency to overlook &lt;strong&gt;boundary conditions&lt;/strong&gt;. Hypothesis is a Python library for property-based testing. Its main goal is to make testing &lt;strong&gt;simpler, faster, and more reliable&lt;/strong&gt;. It uses a method called &lt;strong&gt;property-based testing&lt;/strong&gt;, where you can write some hypotheses for your code, and Hypothesis will automatically generate test cases to verify these hypotheses. This makes it easier to write comprehensive and efficient tests. Hypothesis can automatically generate various types of input data, including basic types (e.g., integers, floats, strings), container types (e.g., lists, sets, dictionaries), and custom types. It tests based on the properties (assertions) you provide. If a test fails, it will try to narrow down the input data to find the smallest failing case. With Hypothesis, you can better cover the boundary conditions of your code and uncover errors you might not have considered. This helps improve the quality and reliability of your code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
