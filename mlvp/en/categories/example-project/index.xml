      <description>&lt;p&gt;Internal signals refer to those not exposed at the moduleâ€™s IO ports, but which play roles in control, data transfer, or state tracking within the module. Typically, when picker converts RTL to DUT, only IO ports are automatically exposed, and internal signals are not exported by default.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, when more detailed verification of internal module logic is needed, or when debugging known issues, verification engineers often need access to these internal signals. In addition to traditional tools like Verilator and VCS, picker also provides an internal signal extraction mechanism as an auxiliary tool.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
