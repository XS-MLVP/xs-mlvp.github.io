      <description>Using Guoke Cache as an example, this document introduces how to create a DUT based on Chisel.&#xA;In this document, a DUT (Design Under Test) refers to the circuit or system being verified during the chip verification process. The DUT is the primary subject of verification. When creating a DUT based on the picker tool, it is essential to consider the functionality, performance requirements, and verification goals of the subject under test.</description>

      <description>This section introduces the general process of verifying a DUT based on Picker.&#xA;The goal of the open verification platform is functional verification, which generally involves the following steps:&#xA;1. Determine the verification object and goals Typically, the design documentation of the DUT is also delivered to the verification engineer. At this point, you need to read the documentation or source code to understand the basic functions, main structure, and expected functionalities of the verification object.</description>

      <description>After we complete the DUT verification, writing a verification report is a crucial step. This section will provide an overview of the structure of the verification report and the content that needs to be covered.&#xA;The verification report is a review of the entire verification process and an important supporting document for determining the reasonableness of the verification. Generally, the verification report should include the following content:&#xA;Basic document information (author, log, version, etc.</description>
